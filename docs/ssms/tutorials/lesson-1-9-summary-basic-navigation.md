# Lesson 1-9 - Summary - Basic Navigation
The [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] design surface can be customized to your personal preference and work requirements.  
  
The following are best practices for using the [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)] workspace efficiently:  
  
-   Close windows you do not expect to use right away.  
  
-   If the tool you want is not visible, select it from the **View** menu.  
  
-   Use **Auto Hide** to provide more room in the environment layout.  
  
-   Set the **At startup** option to customize the default layout.
