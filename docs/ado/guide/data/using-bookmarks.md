# Using Bookmarks
It is often useful to return directly to a specific record after having moved around in the **Recordset** without having to scroll through every record and compare values. For example, if you attempt to search for a record using the **Find** method but the search returns no records, you are automatically placed at either end of the **Recordset**. If your provider supports them, bookmarks can be used to mark your place before using the **Find** method so you can return to your location. A bookmark is a **Variant** type value that uniquely identifies a record in a **Recordset** object.  
  
 You can also use a variant array of bookmarks with the **Recordset Filter** method to filter on a selected set of records. For details about this technique, see Filtering the Results in the topic, [Working with Recordsets](../../../ado/guide/data/working-with-recordsets.md), later in this section.  
  
 You can use the **Bookmark** property to get a bookmark for a record, or set the current record in a **Recordset** object to the record identified by a valid bookmark. The following code uses the **Bookmark** property to set a bookmark and then return to the bookmarked record after moving on to other records. To determine if your **Recordset** supports bookmarks, use the **Supports** method.  
  
```  
'BeginBookmarkEg  
Dim varBookmark As Variant  
Dim blnCanBkmrk As Boolean  
  
objRs.Open strSQL, strConnStr, adOpenStatic, adLockOptimistic, adCmdText  
  
If objRs.RecordCount > 4 Then  
    objRs.Move 4                       ' move to the fifth record  
    blnCanBkmrk = objRs.Supports(adBookmark)  
    If blnCanBkmrk = True Then  
        varBookmark = objRs.Bookmark   ' record the bookmark  
        objRs.MoveLast                 ' move to a different record  
        objRs.Bookmark = varBookmark   ' return to the bookmarked (sixth) record  
    End If  
End If  
'EndBookmarkEg  
```  
  
 The [Supports](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/supports-method.md) method is covered in more detail later.  
  
 Except for the case of cloned **Recordsets**, bookmarks are unique to the **Recordset** in which they were created, even if the same command is used. This means that you cannot use a **Bookmark** obtained from one **Recordset** to move to the same record in a second **Recordset** opened with the same command.
