# sys.fn_xe_file_target_read_file (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server SQL Database SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

Reads files created by the Extended Events asynchronous file target. One event, in XML format, is returned per row.

The Extended Events `event_file` target stores the data it receives in a binary format that isn't human readable. Read the contents of the `.xel` file with the `sys.fn_xe_file_target_read_file` function. These files can also be read from [!INCLUDE [ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)]. For a walkthrough, see [Quickstart: Extended Events](../extended-events/quick-start-extended-events-in-sql-server.md).

## Syntax

```syntaxsql
sys.fn_xe_file_target_read_file ( path , mdpath , initial_file_name , initial_offset )
```

## Arguments

#### *path*

The path to the files to read. *path* can contain wildcards and include the name of a file. *path* is **nvarchar(260)** with no default. In the context of Azure SQL Database, this value is an HTTP URL to a file in Azure Storage.

#### *mdpath*

The path to the metadata file that corresponds to the file or files specified by the *path* argument. *mdpath* is **nvarchar(260)** with no default.

In [!INCLUDE [sssql11-md](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] and later versions, you don't need this parameter. It was retained for backward compatibility, for log files generated in previous versions of SQL Server. In [!INCLUDE [sssql16-md](../../includes/sssql16-md.md)] and later versions, this parameter can be given as `NULL`, as `.xem` files are no longer used.

#### *initial_file_name*

The first file to read from *path*. *initial_file_name* is **nvarchar(260)** with no default. If `NULL` is specified as the argument, all the files found in *path* are read.

> [!NOTE]  
> *initial_file_name* and *initial_offset* are paired arguments. If you specify a value for either argument, you must specify a value for the other argument.

#### *initial_offset*

Used to specify last offset read previously and skips all events up to the offset (inclusive). Event enumeration starts after the offset specified. *initial_offset* is **bigint**. If `NULL` is specified as the argument, the entire file is read.

## Table returned

| Column name | Data type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `module_guid` | **uniqueidentifier** | The event module GUID. Not nullable. |
| `package_guid` | **uniqueidentifier** | The event package GUID. Not nullable. |
| `object_name` | **nvarchar(256)** | The name of the event. Not nullable. |
| `event_data` | **nvarchar(max)** | The event contents, in XML format. Not nullable. |
| `file_name` | **nvarchar(260)** | The name of the file that contains the event. Not nullable. |
| `file_offset` | **bigint** | The offset of the block in the file that contains the event. Not nullable. |
| `timestamp_utc` | **datetime2(7)** | The date and time (UTC timezone) of the event. Not nullable.<br /><br />**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE [sssql17](../../includes/sssql17-md.md)] and later versions, and [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)]. |

## Remarks

Reading large result sets by executing `sys.fn_xe_file_target_read_file` in [!INCLUDE [ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)] might result in an error. Use the **Results to File** mode (in [!INCLUDE [ssmanstudiofull-md](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], **Ctrl+Shift+F**) to export large result sets to a human-readable file, to read the file with another tool instead.

[!INCLUDE [sql2008-md](../../includes/sql2008-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE [sql2008r2](../../includes/sql2008r2-md.md)] accept trace results generated in XEL and XEM format. [!INCLUDE [ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] Extended Events only support trace results in XEL format. We recommend that you use [!INCLUDE [ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)] to read trace results in XEL format.

### Azure SQL

In [!INCLUDE [ssazuremi-md](../../includes/ssazuremi-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)], store `.xel` files in Azure Blob Storage. You can use `sys.fn_xe_file_target_read_file` to read from extended event sessions you create yourself and store in Azure Blob Storage. For example walkthrough, review [Create an event session with an event_file target in Azure Storage](/azure/azure-sql/database/xevent-code-event-file).

If you specify wildcard and/or a path for a local file system, you receive an error message similar to:

```output
Msg 40538, Level 16, State 3, Line 15
A valid URL beginning with 'https://' is required as value for any filepath specified.
```

## Permissions

In [!INCLUDE [sssql19-md](../../includes/sssql19-md.md)] and previous versions, requires `VIEW SERVER STATE` permission on the server.

In [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../../includes/sssql22-md.md)] and later versions, requires `VIEW SERVER PERFORMANCE STATE` permission on the server.

## Examples

### A. Retrieve data from file targets

For [!INCLUDE [ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)] and previous versions, the following example gets all the rows from all the files, including both the `.xel` and `.xem` file. In this example, the file targets and metafiles are located in the trace folder in the `C:\traces\` folder.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM sys.fn_xe_file_target_read_file('C:\traces\*.xel', 'C:\traces\metafile.xem', NULL, NULL);
```

In [!INCLUDE [ssSQL16](../../includes/sssql16-md.md)] and later versions, the following example retrieves events inside all `.xel` files in the default folder. The default location is `\MSSQL\Log` within the installation folder of the instance.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM sys.fn_xe_file_target_read_file('*.xel', NULL, NULL, NULL);
```

In [!INCLUDE [sssql17](../../includes/sssql17-md.md)] and later versions, the following example retrieves only data from the last day, from the built-in system_health session. The system_health session is an Extended Events session that is included by default with SQL Server. For more information, see [Use the system_health session](../extended-events/use-the-system-health-session.md).

```sql
SELECT *
FROM sys.fn_xe_file_target_read_file('system_health*.xel', NULL, NULL, NULL)
WHERE cast(timestamp_utc as datetime2(7)) > DATEADD(DAY, -1, GETUTCDATE());
```
