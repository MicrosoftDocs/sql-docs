# Using WQL and Scripting Languages with the WMI Provider
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
  Management applications access [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] services and network settings using the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Provider for Configuration Management objects in two ways:  
  
-   Using a WQL editor or query tool, such as WBEMTest.exe to query the object set with the Windows Management Instrumentation Language (WQL).  
  
-   Using a scripting language, such as VBScript.  
  
 Alternatively, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] services and network settings can be managed programmatically using the WMI managed objects in SMO. For more information about programming WMI managed objects, see [Managing Services and Network Settings by Using WMI Provider](../../relational-databases/server-management-objects-smo/tasks/managing-services-and-network-settings-by-using-wmi-provider.md).  
  
 The WMI provider for Configuration Management can be accessed by using the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Configuration Manager and [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Management Console. For more information about accessing the WMI provider from a user interface, see [Managing Services How-to Topics &#40;SQL Server Configuration Manager&#41;](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/78dee169-df0c-4c95-9af7-bf033bc9fdc6).
