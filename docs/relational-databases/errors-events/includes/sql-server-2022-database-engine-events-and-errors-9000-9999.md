| Error | Severity | Event logged | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [9001](../mssqlserver-9001-database-engine-error.md) | 21 | Yes | The log for database '%.\*ls' is not available. Check the operating system error log for related error messages. Resolve any errors and restart the database. |
| [9002](../mssqlserver-9002-database-engine-error.md) | 17 | Yes | The transaction log for database '%ls' is full due to '%ls' and the holdup lsn is %S_LSN. |
| [9003](../mssqlserver-9003-database-engine-error.md) | 20 | Yes | The log scan number %S_LSN passed to log scan in database '%.\*ls' is not valid. This error may indicate data corruption or that the log file (.ldf) does not match the data file (.mdf). If this error occurred during replication, re-create the publication. Otherwise, restore from backup if the problem results in a failure during startup. |
| [9004](../mssqlserver-9004-database-engine-error.md) | 21 | Yes | An error occurred while processing the log for database '%.\*ls'. If possible, restore from backup. If a backup is not available, it might be necessary to rebuild the log. |
| 9005 | 16 | No | Invalid parameter passed to OpenRowset(DBLog, ...). |
| 9006 | 10 | No | Cannot shrink log file %d (%s) because total number of logical log files cannot be fewer than %d. |
| 9007 | 10 | No | Cannot shrink log file %d (%s) because requested size (%dKB) is larger than the start of the last logical log file. |
| 9008 | 10 | No | Cannot shrink log file %d (%s) because the logical log file located at the end of the file is in use. |
| 9009 | 10 | No | Cannot shrink log file %d (%s) because of minimum log space required. |
| 9010 | 14 | No | User does not have permission to query the virtual table, DBLog. Only members of the sysadmin fixed server role and the db_owner fixed database role have this permission |
