# Distributor and Publisher Information Script
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
  This script uses system tables and replication stored procedures to answer questions commonly asked about objects at the Distributor and Publisher. The script can be used "as-is" and can also provide the basis for customized scripts. The script might require two modifications to run in your environment:  
  
-   Change the line `use AdventureWorks2012` to use the name of your publication database.  
  
-   Remove the comments (`--`) from the line `exec sp_helparticle @publication='<PublicationName>'` and replace \<PublicationName> with the name of a publication.  
  
```

--Is the current server a Distributor?  
--Is the distribution database installed?  
--Are there other Publishers using this Distributor?

SELECT name as tran_published_db FROM sys.databases WHERE is_published = 1;  
--Which databases are published using merge replication?

EXEC sp_helpmergepublication;  
--What are the articles in merge publications in this database?  
EXEC sp_helpmergearticle; -- to return information on articles for a single publication, specify @publication='<PublicationName>'  
  
--Which objects in the database are published?  
SELECT name AS published_object, schema_id, is_published AS is_tran_published, is_merge_published, is_schema_published  
FROM sys.tables WHERE is_published = 1 or is_merge_published = 1 or is_schema_published = 1  
UNION

SELECT name AS published_object, schema_id, 0, 0, is_schema_published  
FROM sys.views WHERE is_schema_published = 1;  
  
--Which columns are published in snapshot or transactional publications in this database?  
SELECT object_name(object_id) AS tran_published_table, name AS published_column FROM sys.columns WHERE is_replicated = 1;  
  
--Which columns are published in merge publications in this database?  
SELECT object_name(object_id) AS merge_published_table, name AS published_column FROM sys.columns WHERE is_merge_published = 1;
