## Message Details

|-|-|  
|Product Name|SQL Server|  
|Event ID|-2147199466|  
|Event Source|MSSQLServer|  
|Symbolic Name||  
|Message Text|The merge process could not perform retention-based metadata cleanup in database '%1'. If this failure continues, try increasing the query timeout for this process, or try reducing the retention period. When troubleshooting, restart the synchronization with verbose history logging and specify an output file to which to write.|  
  
## Explanation  
 A procedure that was called to perform this action failed.  
  
## User Action  
 Run [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../includes/sssqlprofiler-md.md)] and examine replmerg.log for failures. If you are using Web Synchronization, elevate the severity of the websync log, rerun the scenario, and check for errors in the websync.log file.  
  
 If you are using Web Synchronization, you can start Replmerg.exe and pass the **-T 106** option to use trace flag 106. This enables you to see the messages that are sent to and from the Publisher. By adding the trace flag to the Replmerg.exe agent command line, the agent writes the client's input messages to a file that is named ExchangeID(*guid*).IN.XML, and writes the output messages to a file that is named ExchangeID(*guid*).OUT.XML. (In these file names, *guid* is the GUID of the Exchange Server session.) These files are created in the directory from which Replmerg.exe was invoked. For security, you should delete these files after you are finished.
