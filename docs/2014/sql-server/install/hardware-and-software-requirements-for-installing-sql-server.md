# Hardware and Software Requirements for Installing SQL Server 2014

 > - Try SQL Server 2016 by installing the **[Free Developer edition](https://my.visualstudio.com/Downloads?q=SQL%20Server%20Developer)!**  
  
## Considerations 
  
-   We recommend running [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] on computers with the NTFS file format. FAT32 file system is supported but not recommended as it is less secure than the NTFS file system.  
  
-   You cannot install on read-only, mapped, or compressed drives.  
  
-   To allow the Visual Studio component to install correctly, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] requires you to install an update. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup checks for the presence of this update then requires you to download and install that update before you can continue with the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] installation. To avoid the interruption during [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup, download and install the update **before running [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup** as described below (or install all the updates for .NET 3.5 SP1 available on Windows Update):  
  
    -   For [!INCLUDE[firstref_longhorn](../../includes/firstref-longhorn-md.md)] SP2, get the required update [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=198093).  
  
    -   For any other supported operating system, this update is included.  
  
-   Launching [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup through Terminal Services Client is not supported. Installation fails if you launch setup through Terminal Services Client.   
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup installs the following software components required by the product:  
  
    -   [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client  
  
    -   [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup support files  
  
-   For minimum version requirements to install [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on [!INCLUDE[win8srv](../../includes/win8srv-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[win8](../../includes/win8-md.md)], see [Installing SQL Server on Windows Server 2012 or Windows 8](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2681562) (https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2681562).

##  <a name="hwswr"></a> Hardware and Software Requirements  
 The following requirements apply to all [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] installations:  
  
|Component|Requirement|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|.NET Framework|.NET 3.5 SP1 is a requirement for [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] when you select [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssDQSnoversion](../../includes/ssdqsnoversion-md.md)], Replication, or [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], and it is no longer installed by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup. <br />-If you run Setup and you do not have .NET 3.5 SP1, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup requires you to download and install .NET 3.5 SP1 before you can continue with the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] installation. (Install .NET 3.5 SP1 from [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=22).) The error message includes a link to the download center, or you can download .NET 3.5 SP1 from Windows Update. To avoid interruption during [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup, you can download and install .NET 3.5 SP1 before you run [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup.<br />-If you run Setup on a computer with [!INCLUDE[winserver2008r2](../../includes/winserver2008r2-md.md)] SP1 or [!INCLUDE[win8](../../includes/win8-md.md)], you must enable .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 before you install [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)].<br />-If there is no internet access, you must download and install .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 before you run Setup to install any of the above mentioned components. For more information about the recommendations and guidance on how to acquire and enable .NET Framework 3.5 on [!INCLUDE[win8](../../includes/win8-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[win8srv](../../includes/win8srv-md.md)], see [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 Deployment Considerations](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh975396) (https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh975396).<br /><br /> .NET 4.0 is a requirement for [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)]. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] installs .NET 4.0 during the feature installation step.<br />-If you are installing the [!INCLUDE[ssExpress](../../includes/ssexpress-md.md)] editions, ensure that an Internet connection is available on the computer. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup downloads and installs the .NET Framework 4 because it is not included in the [!INCLUDE[ssExpress](../../includes/ssexpress-md.md)] media.<br />-[!INCLUDE[ssExpress](../../includes/ssexpress-md.md)] does not install .NET 4.0 on the Server Core mode of [!INCLUDE[winserver2008r2](../../includes/winserver2008r2-md.md)] SP1 or [!INCLUDE[win8srv](../../includes/win8srv-md.md)]. You must install .NET 4.0 before you install [!INCLUDE[ssExpress](../../includes/ssexpress-md.md)] on a Server Core installation of [!INCLUDE[winserver2008r2](../../includes/winserver2008r2-md.md)] SP1 or [!INCLUDE[win8srv](../../includes/win8srv-md.md)].|  
|Windows PowerShell|[!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] does not install or enable Windows PowerShell 2.0; however Windows PowerShell 2.0 is an installation prerequisite for [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] components and [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)]. If Setup reports that Windows PowerShell 2.0 is not present, you can install or enable it by following the instructions on the [Windows Management Framework](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=186214) page.|  
|Network Software|Supported operating systems for [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] have built-in network software. Named and default instances of a stand-alone installation support the following network protocols: Shared memory, Named Pipes, TCP/IP and VIA.<br /><br /> Note: VIA protocol is not supported on failover clusters. Clients or applications running on the same node of the failover cluster as the SQL Server instance, can use Shared Memory protocol to connect to SQL Server using its local pipe address. However this type of connection is not cluster-aware and will fail after an instance failover. It is therefore not recommended and should only be used in very specific scenarios. The VIA protocol is deprecated. [!INCLUDE[ssNoteDepFutureAvoid](../../includes/ssnotedepfutureavoid-md.md)]<br /><br /> For more information about Network Protocols and Network Libraries, see [Network Protocols and Network Libraries](network-protocols-and-network-libraries.md).|  
|Virtualization|[!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] is supported in virtual machine environments running on the Hyper-V role in:<br />-<br />                    [!INCLUDE[nextref_longhorn](../../includes/nextref-longhorn-md.md)] SP2 Standard, Enterprise and Datacenter editions<br />-[!INCLUDE[winserver2008r2](../../includes/winserver2008r2-md.md)] SP1 Standard, Enterprise, and Datacenter editions.<br />-<br />                    [!INCLUDE[win8srv](../../includes/win8srv-md.md)] Datacenter and Standard editions.<br /><br /> In addition to resources required by the parent partition, each virtual machine (child partition) must be provided with sufficient processor resources, memory, and disk resources for its [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] instance. Requirements are listed later in this topic.\*<br /><br /> Within the Hyper-V role on [!INCLUDE[nextref_longhorn](../../includes/nextref-longhorn-md.md)] SP2 or [!INCLUDE[winserver2008r2](../../includes/winserver2008r2-md.md)] SP1, a maximum of 4 (four) virtual processors can be allocated to virtual machines running [!INCLUDE[nextref_longhorn](../../includes/nextref-longhorn-md.md)] SP2 32-bit/64-bit or [!INCLUDE[winserver2008r2](../../includes/winserver2008r2-md.md)] SP1 64-bit or [!INCLUDE[win8srv](../../includes/win8srv-md.md)] 64-bit editions.<br /><br /> Within the Hyper-V role on [!INCLUDE[win8srv](../../includes/win8srv-md.md)]:<br />A maximum of 8 (eight) virtual processors can be allocated to virtual machines running [!INCLUDE[nextref_longhorn](../../includes/nextref-longhorn-md.md)] SP2 32-bit/64-bit.<br />A maximum of 64 (sixty-four) virtual processors can be allocated to virtual machines running [!INCLUDE[winserver2008r2](../../includes/winserver2008r2-md.md)] SP1 64-bit or [!INCLUDE[win8srv](../../includes/win8srv-md.md)] 64-bit editions.<br /><br /> For more information on compute capacity limits for different editions of [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] and how they differ in physical and virtualized environments with hyperthreaded processors, see [Compute Capacity Limits by Edition of SQL Server](../compute-capacity-limits-by-edition-of-sql-server.md). For more information about the Hyper-V role, see the [Windows Server 2008 Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=182820).<br /><br /> **\*\* Important \*\*** Guest failover clustering is supported in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)]. For more information about the supported versions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and operating systems for guest failover clustering, and the support for virtualization, see [Support policy for Microsoft SQL Server products running in a hardware virtual environment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=151676).|  
|Hard Disk|[!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] requires a minimum of 6 GB of available hard-disk space.<br /><br /> Disk space requirements will vary with the [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] components you install. For more information, see [Hard Disk Space Requirements (32-Bit and 64 Bit)](hardware-and-software-requirements-for-installing-sql-server.md#harddiskspace) later in this topic. For information on supported storage types for data files, see [Storage Types for Data Files](hardware-and-software-requirements-for-installing-sql-server.md#StorageTypes).|  
|Drive|A DVD drive, as appropriate, is required for installation from disc.|  
|Monitor|[!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] requires Super-VGA (800x600) or higher resolution monitor.|  
|Internet|Internet functionality requires Internet access (fees may apply).|  
  
 *Running [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] on a virtual machine will be slower than running natively because of the overhead of virtualization.  
  
##  <a name="pmosr"></a> Processor, Memory, and Operating System Requirements  
 The following memory and processor requirements apply to all editions of [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)]:  
  
|Component|Requirement|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|Memory<sup>[1]</sup>|**Minimum:**<br /><br /> Express Editions: 512 MB<br /><br /> All other editions: 1 GB<br /><br /> **Recommended:**<br /><br /> Express Editions: 1 GB<br /><br /> All other editions: At least 4 GB and should be increased as database size increases to ensure optimal performance.|  
|Processor Speed|**Minimum:**<br /><br /> x86 Processor: 1.0 GHz<br /><br /> x64 Processor: 1.4 GHz<br /><br /> **Recommended:** 2.0 GHz or faster|  
|Processor Type|x64 Processor: AMD Opteron, AMD Athlon 64, Intel Xeon with Intel EM64T support, Intel Pentium IV with EM64T support<br /><br /> x86 Processor: Pentium III-compatible processor or faster|  
  
 <sup>[1]</sup>The minimum memory required for installing the [!INCLUDE[ssDQSServer](../../includes/ssdqsserver-md.md)] component in [!INCLUDE[ssDQSnoversion](../../includes/ssdqsnoversion-md.md)] (DQS) is 2 GB of RAM, which is different from the [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] minimum memory requirement. For information about installing DQS, see [Install Data Quality Services](../../data-quality-services/install-windows/install-data-quality-services.md).  
  
 **WOW64 Support:**  
  
 WOW64 (Windows 32-bit on Windows 64-bit) is a feature of 64-bit editions of Windows that enables 32-bit applications to run natively in 32-bit mode. Applications function in 32-bit mode, even though the underlying operating system is a 64-bit operating system.  
  
-   On a supported 64-bit operating system, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 32-bit edition can be installed to the WOW64 32-bit subsystem of a 64-bit server. WOW64 is supported only for stand-alone instances of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. WOW64 is not supported for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] failover cluster installations.  
  
-   For [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 64-bit edition installations on supported 64-bit operating systems, Management Tools are supported in WOW64. For more information about supported operating systems, select an edition of [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] from the sections below.  
  
 **Server Core Support:**  

 [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)]  is now supported on a Server Core installation of Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2016, and Windows Server 2019. 

Installing [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] is supported on the following Server Core mode of the editions of Windows Server:

|                              |                                |

## Minimum SQL Server version requirements for Windows 10  
 Before you install SQL Server on a computer that is running Windows 10, you must make sure that you fulfill the following minimum requirements:  
  
-   For SQL Server 2014, you must apply SQL Server 2014 Service Pack 1 or a later update. For more information, see [How to obtain the latest service pack for SQL Server 2014](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2958069).  
  
-   For SQL Server 2012, you must apply SQL Server 2012 Service Pack 2 or a later update. For more information, see [How to obtain the latest service pack for SQL Server 2012](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2755533).  
  
-   SQL Server 2008 R2  
    and SQL Server 2008 is not supported on Windows 10.  
  
##  <a name="CrossLanguageSupport"></a> Cross-Language Support  
 For more information about cross-language support and considerations for installing [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] in localized languages, see [Local Language Versions in SQL Server](local-language-versions-in-sql-server.md).  
  
##  <a name="ess"></a> Extended System Support  
 [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] 64-bit versions include support for extended systems, also known as Windows 32-bit on Windows 64-bit (WOW64). WOW64 is a feature of 64-bit editions of Windows that enables 32-bit applications to execute natively in 32-bit mode. Applications function in 32-bit mode even though the underlying operating system is 64-bit.  
  
##  <a name="HardDiskSpace"></a> Hard Disk Space Requirements (32-Bit and 64 Bit)  
 During installation Windows Installer creates temporary files on the system drive. Before you run Setup to install or upgrade [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], verify that you have at least **6.0 GB** of available disk space on the system drive for these files. This requirement applies even if you install components to a non-default drive.  
  
 Actual hard disk space requirements depend on your system configuration and the features that you decide to install. For a list of features supported by the editions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], see [Features Supported by the Editions of SQL Server 2014](../../getting-started/features-supported-by-the-editions-of-sql-server-2014.md). The following table provides disk space requirements for [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] components.  
  
|**Feature**|**Disk space requirement**|  
|-----------------|--------------------------------|  
|[!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] and data files, Replication, Full-Text Search, and Data Quality Services|811 MB|  
|[!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] and data files|345 MB|  
|[!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] and Report Manager|304 MB|  
|[!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)]|591 MB|  
|[!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)]|243 MB|  
|Client Components (other than [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Books Online components and Integration Services tools)|1823 MB|  
|[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Books Online Components to view and manage help content<sup>1</sup>|375 KB|  
  
 <sup>1</sup>The disk space requirement for downloaded Books Online content is 200 MB.  
  
##  <a name="StorageTypes"></a> Storage Types for Data Files  
 The supported storage types for data files are:  
  
-   Local Disk  
  
-   Shared Storage  
  
-   SMB File Share  
  
    > **NOTE:**  SMB storage is not supported for [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] data files for either standalone or clustered installations. Use direct attached storage or a storage area network instead.  
  
    > **IMPORTANT!!** SMB storage can be hosted by a Windows File Server or a third party SMB storage device. If Windows File Server is used, the Windows File Server version should be 2008 or later. For more information about installing [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] using SMB file share as a storage option, see [Install SQL Server with SMB Fileshare as a Storage Option](../../database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server-with-smb-fileshare-as-a-storage-option.md).  
  
    > **WARNING!!!!**  [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] failover cluster installation supports Local Disk only for installing the tempdb files. Ensure that the path specified for the tempdb data and log files is valid on **all** of the cluster nodes. During failover, if the tempdb directories are not available on the failover target node, the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] resource will fail to come online.  
  
##  <a name="DC_support"></a> Installing [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on a Domain Controller - Limitations  
 For security reasons, we recommend that you do not install [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] on a domain controller. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup will not block installation on a computer that is a domain controller, but the following limitations apply:  
  
-   You cannot run [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] services on a domain controller under a local service account.  
  
-   After [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is installed on a computer, you cannot change the computer from a domain member to a domain controller. You must uninstall [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] before you change the host computer to a domain controller.  
  
-   After [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is installed on a computer, you cannot change the computer from a domain controller to a domain member. You must uninstall [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] before you change the host computer to a domain member.  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] failover cluster instances are not supported where cluster nodes are domain controllers.  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup cannot create security groups or provision [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] service accounts on a read-only domain controller. In this scenario, Setup will fail.
