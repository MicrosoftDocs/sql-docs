# Data Mining Tutorials (Analysis Services)
[!INCLUDE[ssas-appliesto-sqlas](../includes/ssas-appliesto-sqlas.md)]

[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] makes it easy to create data mining solutions using wizards and integrated visualizations. Particularly if you are new to machine learning, the tools in [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] are an easy way to design, train, and explore data mining models. The data in your models can be stored in a cube, relational database, or any other source support by [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)]. After creating a model, you can put it into production by accessing the model to create predictions using prediction multiple clients, including [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] and ASP.NET.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>The tutorials described here have not been updated for [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)]. You can use the tutorials created for SQL Server 2014. Functionally, there are no changes in Data Mining features for [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)]. The steps should be identical.  
  
## Tutorials  
  
[Basic Data Mining Tutorial (SQL Server 2014)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms167167(v=sql.120).aspx) - This tutorial walks you through a targeted mailing scenario. It demonstrates how to use the data mining algorithms, mining model viewers, and data mining tools that are included in [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)]. You will build three data mining models to answer practical business questions while learning data mining concepts and tools.  
  
[Intermediate Data Mining Tutorial (SQL Server 2014)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc879271(v=sql.120).aspx) - This tutorial contains a collection of lessons that introduce more advanced data mining concepts and techniques such as, forecasting, market basket analysis, neural networks and logistic regression, and sequence clustering.  
  
[DMX Tutorials (SQL Server 2014)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb895168(v=sql.120).aspx) - The Data Mining Extensions (DMX) query language has syntax like that of SQL but can be used to create, query, and manage predictive models stored in [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)]. These tutorials demonstrate how to create a new mining structure and mining models by using the DMX language, and how to create DMX prediction queries for use in applications.
