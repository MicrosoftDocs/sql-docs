You can connect to a database on SQL Server and Azure SQL using Go on Windows, Linux, or macOS.

## Get started

[Quickstart: Use Golang to query a database in Azure SQL Database or Azure SQL Managed Instance](/azure/azure-sql/database/connect-query-go) guides you through the configuration of the environment. It also includes a simple test application to connect to a SQL Server data source.

## Documentation

Documentation for the `go-mssqldb` driver is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/go-mssqldb#readme).

## Samples

Several samples are available in [Developing applications with Go and Azure SQL](/samples/azure-samples/azuresqlgettingstartedsamples/developing-applications-with-go-and-azure-sql).
