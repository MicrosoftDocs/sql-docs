# Monitoring R Services
  This section provides information about these common monitoring tasks when using [!INCLUDE[rsql_productname](../../includes/rsql-productname-md.md)]:  
  
-   Identifying server resources being used by R  
  
-   Monitoring the status of R tools  
  
-   Determining the jobs that are executing using the R runtime  
  
-   Identifying remote R jobs that are using the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance as the compute context  
  
-   Correlating long-running queries with R jobs  
  
-   Terminating R processes  
  
 The topic also describes the tools installed on the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] computer as part of R setup, and lists the DMVs and Extended Events related to [!INCLUDE[rsql_productname](../../includes/rsql-productname-md.md)].
