# O2SS0268: Hierarchical query with outer join cannot be converted (Error)

This article describes why SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Oracle does not convert the PL/SQL block when `OUTER JOIN`s are used in hierarchical queries.

## Background

In Oracle, `CONNECT BY PRIOR` is a condition that identifies the relationship between parent rows and child rows of the hierarchy. `OUTER JOIN` includes data rows in the result set that do not have a match in the joined table and returns these missing columns as `NULL` values.

When an `OUTER JOIN` clause is used with `CONNECT BY PRIOR` in hierarchical queries, SSMA does not convert the statement and generates an error message.

## Example

Consider the example below in which `LEFT OUTER JOIN` clause is used with `CONNECT BY PRIOR` clause in the hierarchical query:

```sql
SELECT
    e.empno,
    e1.empno,
    e1.mgr
FROM
    emp e
    LEFT OUTER JOIN emp1 e1
        ON e.empno = e1.empno
CONNECT BY PRIOR e1.mgr = e.deptno;
```

## Possible remedies

To resolve the above issue, rewrite the SQL code by using recursive CTE (Common Table Expression) method as shown below:

```sql
WITH EMPTEMP (empno, ename, mgr) AS
(
    SELECT
        empno,
        ename,
        MGR
    FROM emp

    UNION ALL

    SELECT
        e.empno,
        e.ename,
        e.MGR
    FROM
        emp e
        JOIN emp1 e1
            ON e1.mgr = e.deptno
)
SELECT
    e2.EMPNO,
    e1.EMPNO AS empno$2,
    e1.mgr
FROM
    EMPTEMP AS e2
    LEFT OUTER JOIN EMP1 AS e1
        ON e2.EMPNO = e1.EMPNO
```
