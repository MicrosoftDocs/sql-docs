# Disconnect from a Registered Server (SQL Server Management Studio)
  This topic describes how to  disconnect Object Explorer from a server at any time in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)]. Disconnecting Object Explorer does not disconnect other [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] components such as SQL Editor.
