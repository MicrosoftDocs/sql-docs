# How to Manage a CDC Service from the CDC Designer Console
  This procedure describes how to use the CDC Designer Console to manage a CDC service.  
  
### To manage a CDC service from the CDC Designer Console  
  
1.  From the **Start** menu, select the **CDC Designer Console**.  
  
2.  In the left pane, expand **Change Data Capture**.  
  
3.  Select the service you want to manage.  
  
     **Note**: If there are no services listed in the CDC Designer Console, you must create new instances using the CDC Service Configuration Console. For information about creating a new service, see the online help included with the service configuration console.  
  
4.  You can carry out the following tasks for a CDC service:  
  
    -   Create a **New CDC Instance**  
  
    -   **Start All Instances** (that are included in the selected CDC service)  
  
    -   **Stop All Instances** (that are included in the selected CDC service)  
  
     For information about these tasks, see [Manage a CDC Service](../../integration-services/change-data-capture/manage-a-cdc-service.md).  
  
 Other CDC service tasks are carried out using the CDC Service Configuration Console. For information about the tasks you can carry out in the service configuration console, see the online help included with the service configuration console.
