There are several python SQL drivers available. However, Microsoft places its testing efforts and its confidence in **pyodbc** driver. Choose one of the following drivers, and configure your development environment:

- [Python SQL driver - pyodbc](pyodbc/python-sql-driver-pyodbc.md)
- [Python SQL driver - pymssql](pymssql/python-sql-driver-pymssql.md)
  
## Documentation

For documentation, see [Python documentation at Python.org](https://www.python.org/doc/).  
  
## Community

- [Azure Python Developer Center](https://azure.microsoft.com/develop/python/)  
- [python.org Community](https://www.python.org/community/)  
  
## Samples
