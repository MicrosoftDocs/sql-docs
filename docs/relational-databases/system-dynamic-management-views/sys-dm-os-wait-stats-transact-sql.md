# sys.dm_os_wait_stats (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE [sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

Returns information about all the waits encountered by threads that executed. You can use this aggregated view to diagnose performance issues with [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and also with specific queries and batches. [sys.dm_exec_session_wait_stats (Transact-SQL)](../../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-exec-session-wait-stats-transact-sql.md) provides similar information by session.

> [!NOTE]

## Permissions

On [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion_md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and SQL Managed Instance, requires `VIEW SERVER STATE` permission.

On SQL Database **Basic**, **S0**, and **S1** service objectives, and for databases in **elastic pools**, the [server admin](/azure/azure-sql/database/logins-create-manage#existing-logins-and-user-accounts-after-creating-a-new-database) account, the [Azure Active Directory admin](/azure/azure-sql/database/authentication-aad-overview#administrator-structure) account, or membership in the `##MS_ServerStateReader##` [server role](/azure/azure-sql/database/security-server-roles) is required. On all other SQL Database service objectives, either the `VIEW DATABASE STATE` permission on the database, or membership in the `##MS_ServerStateReader##` server role is required.

## <a id="WaitTypes"></a> Types of waits

 **Resource waits** occur when a worker requests access to a resource that isn't available because the resource is being used by some other worker or isn't yet available. Examples of resource waits are locks, latches, network, and disk I/O waits. Lock and latch waits are waits on synchronization objects.

**Queue waits** occur when a worker is idle, waiting for work to be assigned. Queue waits are most typically seen with system background tasks such as the deadlock monitor and deleted record cleanup tasks. These tasks will wait for work requests to be placed into a work queue. Queue waits may also periodically become active even if no new packets have been put on the queue.

 **External waits** occur when a [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] worker is waiting for an external event, such as an extended stored procedure call or a linked server query, to finish. When you diagnose blocking issues, remember that external waits don't always imply that the worker is idle, because the worker may actively be running some external code.

 This dynamic management view shows the time for waits that have completed. This dynamic management view doesn't show current waits.

 A [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] worker thread isn't considered to be waiting if any of the following is true:

- A resource becomes available.

- A queue is nonempty.

- An external process finishes.

 Although the thread is no longer waiting, the thread doesn't have to start running immediately. This is because such a thread is first put on the queue of runnable workers and must wait for a quantum to run on the scheduler.

 In [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] the wait-time counters are **bigint** values and therefore aren't as prone to counter rollover as the equivalent counters in earlier versions of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].

 Specific types of wait times during query execution can indicate bottlenecks or stall points within the query. Similarly, high wait times, or wait counts server wide can indicate bottlenecks or hot spots in interaction query interactions within the server instance. For example, lock waits indicate data contention by queries; page IO latch waits indicate slow IO response times; page latch update waits indicate incorrect file layout.

 The contents of this dynamic management view can be reset. This T-SQL command resets all counters to 0:

```sql
DBCC SQLPERF ('sys.dm_os_wait_stats', CLEAR);
GO
```

> [!NOTE]  
> These statistics are not persisted after after the database engine restarts, and all data is cumulative since the last time the statistics were reset or the database engine started. Use the `sqlserver_start_time` column in [sys.dm_os_sys_info](sys-dm-os-sys-info-transact-sql.md) to find the last database engine startup time.

 The following table lists the wait types encountered by tasks.

Verify that the client application is processing data from the server as fast as possible or that no network delays exist. Reasons the client application can't consume data fast enough include: application design issues like writing results to a file while the results arrive, waiting for user input, client-side filtering on a large dataset instead of server-side filtering, or an intentional wait introduced. Also the client computer may be experiencing slow response due to issues like low virtual/physical memory, 100% CPU consumption, etc. Network delays can also lead to this wait - typically caused by network adapter driver issues, filter drivers, firewalls or misconfigured routers. |

| <a id="broker_endpoint_state_mutex"></a>BROKER_ENDPOINT_STATE_MUTEX | Occurs when there is contention to access the state of a Service Broker connection endpoint. Access to the state for changes is serialized. |
| <a id="broker_eventhandler"></a>BROKER_EVENTHANDLER | Occurs when a task is waiting in the primary event handler of the Service Broker. This should occur very briefly. |
| <a id="broker_forwarder"></a>BROKER_FORWARDER | Internal use only.<br /><br />**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE [ssSQL11-md](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] and later versions. |
| <a id="broker_init"></a>BROKER_INIT | Occurs when initializing Service Broker in each active database. This should occur infrequently. |

| <a id="broker_receive_waitfor"></a>BROKER_RECEIVE_WAITFOR | Occurs when the RECEIVE WAITFOR is waiting. This may mean that either no messages are ready to be received in the queue or a lock contention is preventing it from receiving messages from the queue. |
| <a id="broker_registerallendpoints"></a>BROKER_REGISTERALLENDPOINTS | Occurs during the initialization of a Service Broker connection endpoint. This should occur very briefly. |
| <a id="broker_service"></a>BROKER_SERVICE | Occurs when the Service Broker destination list that is associated with a target service is updated or reprioritized. |
| <a id="broker_shutdown"></a>BROKER_SHUTDOWN | Occurs when there is a planned shutdown of Service Broker. This should occur very briefly, if at all. |
| <a id="broker_start"></a>BROKER_START | Internal use only.<br /><br />**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE [ssSQL16-md](../../includes/sssql16-md.md)] and later versions. |
| <a id="broker_task_shutdown"></a>BROKER_TASK_SHUTDOWN | Internal use only.<br /><br />**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE [ssSQL14-md](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)] and later versions. |
| <a id="broker_task_stop"></a>BROKER_TASK_STOP | Occurs when the Service Broker queue task handler tries to shut down the task. The state check is serialized and must be in a running state beforehand. |

| <a id="broker_transmitter"></a>BROKER_TRANSMITTER | Occurs when the Service Broker transmitter is waiting for work. Service Broker has a component known as the Transmitter, which schedules messages from multiple dialogs to be sent across the wire over one or more connection endpoints. The transmitter has 2 dedicated threads for this purpose. This wait type is charged when these transmitter threads are waiting for dialog messages to be sent using the transport connections. High values of `waiting_tasks_count` for this wait type point to intermittent work for these transmitter threads and aren't indications of any performance problem. If service broker isn't used at all, `waiting_tasks_count` should be 2 (for the 2 transmitter threads), and wait_time_ms should be twice the duration since instance startup. See [Service broker wait stats](/archive/blogs/sql_service_broker/service-broker-wait-types). |
| <a id="bufferpool_scan"></a>BUFFERPOOL_SCAN | May occur when the buffer pool scan runs in parallel and the main task waits for the scan to complete. For more information, see [Operations that trigger a buffer pool scan may run slowly on large-memory computers](/troubleshoot/sql/performance/buffer-pool-scan-runs-slowly-large-memory-machines).<br /><br />**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE [ssSQL22](../../includes/sssql22-md.md)] and later versions. |
| <a id="builtin_hashkey_mutex"></a>BUILTIN_HASHKEY_MUTEX | May occur after startup of instance, while internal data structures are initializing. Won't recur once data structures have initialized. |

| <a id="cxconsumer"></a>CXCONSUMER | Occurs with parallel query plans when a consumer thread (parent) waits for a producer thread to send rows. CXCONSUMER waits are caused by an Exchange Iterator that runs out of rows from its producer thread. This is a normal part of parallel query execution.<br /><br />**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] (Starting with [!INCLUDE [sssql16-md](../../includes/sssql16-md.md)] SP2, [!INCLUDE [ssSQL17](../../includes/sssql17-md.md)] CU3), [!INCLUDE [ssSDSfull](../../includes/sssdsfull-md.md)], [!INCLUDE [ssSDSMIfull](../../includes/sssdsmifull-md.md)] |
| <a id="cxpacket"></a>CXPACKET | Occurs with parallel query plans when waiting to synchronize the Query Processor [Exchange Iterator](../../relational-databases/showplan-logical-and-physical-operators-reference.md), and when producing and consuming rows. If waiting is excessive and can't be reduced by tuning the query (such as adding indexes), consider adjusting the Cost Threshold for Parallelism or lowering the Max Degree of Parallelism (MaxDOP).<br /><br />**Note:** Starting with [!INCLUDE [sssql16-md](../../includes/sssql16-md.md)] SP2 and [!INCLUDE [ssSQL17](../../includes/sssql17-md.md)] CU3, CXPACKET only refers to waiting to synchronize the Exchange Iterator and producing rows. Threads consuming rows are tracked separately in the CXCONSUMER wait type. If the consumer threads are too slow, the Exchange Iterator buffer may become full and cause CXPACKET waits.<br /><br />**Note:** In [!INCLUDE [ssSDSfull](../../includes/sssdsfull-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE [ssSDSMIfull](../../includes/sssdsmifull-md.md)], CXPACKET only refers to waiting on threads producing rows. Exchange Iterator synchronization is tracked separately in the CXSYNC_PORT and CXSYNC_CONSUMER wait types. Threads consuming rows are tracked separately in the CXCONSUMER wait type.<br />|

| <a id="dbmirror_events_queue"></a>DBMIRROR_EVENTS_QUEUE | Occurs when database mirroring waits for events to process. |
| <a id="dbmirror_send"></a>DBMIRROR_SEND | Occurs when a task is waiting for a communications backlog at the network layer to clear to be able to send messages. Indicates that the communications layer is starting to become overloaded and affect the database mirroring data throughput. |
| <a id="dbmirror_worker_queue"></a>DBMIRROR_WORKER_QUEUE | Indicates that the database mirroring worker task is waiting for more work. |
| <a id="dbmirroring_cmd"></a>DBMIRRORING_CMD | Occurs when a task is waiting for log records to be flushed to disk. This wait state is expected to be held for long periods of time. |

| <a id="pageiolatch_nl"></a>PAGEIOLATCH_NL | Identified for informational purposes only. Not supported. Future compatibility isn't guaranteed. |
| <a id="pageiolatch_sh"></a>PAGEIOLATCH_SH | Occurs when a task is waiting on a latch for a buffer that is in an I/O request. The latch request is in Shared mode - a mode used when the buffer is being read from disk. Long waits may indicate problems with the disk subsystem.<br /><br />For more information, see [Slow I/O - SQL Server and disk I/O performance](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/sql-server-support/slow-i-o-sql-server-and-disk-i-o-performance/ba-p/333983). |
| <a id="pageiolatch_up"></a>PAGEIOLATCH_UP | Occurs when a task is waiting on a latch for a buffer that is in an I/O request. The latch request is in Update mode. Long waits may indicate problems with the disk subsystem.<br /><br />For more information, see [Slow I/O - SQL Server and disk I/O performance](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/sql-server-support/slow-i-o-sql-server-and-disk-i-o-performance/ba-p/333983). |
| <a id="pagelatch_dt"></a>PAGELATCH_DT | Occurs when a task is waiting on a latch for a buffer that isn't in an I/O request. The latch request is in Destroy mode. Destroy mode must be acquired before deleting contents of a page. For more information, see [Latch Modes](../diagnose-resolve-latch-contention.md#sql-server-latch-modes-and-compatibility). |
| <a id="pagelatch_ex"></a>PAGELATCH_EX | Occurs when a task is waiting on a latch for a buffer that isn't in an I/O request. The latch request is in Exclusive mode - it blocks other threads from writing to or reading from the page (buffer).<br /><br />A common scenario that leads to this latch is the "last-page insert" buffer latch contention. To understand and resolve this, use [Resolve last-page insert PAGELATCH_EX contention](/troubleshoot/sql/performance/resolve-pagelatch-ex-contention) and [Diagnose and resolve last-page-insert latch contention on SQL Server](../diagnose-resolve-latch-contention.md#last-pagetrailing-page-insert-contention). Another scenario is [Latch contention on small tables with a non-clustered index and random inserts (queue table)](../diagnose-resolve-latch-contention.md#latch-contention-on-small-tables-with-a-non-clustered-index-and-random-inserts-queue-table). |
| <a id="pagelatch_kp"></a>PAGELATCH_KP | Occurs when a task is waiting on a latch for a buffer that isn't in an I/O request. The latch request is in Keep mode, which prevents the page from being destroyed by another thread. For more information, see [Latch Modes](../diagnose-resolve-latch-contention.md#sql-server-latch-modes-and-compatibility). |
| <a id="pagelatch_nl"></a>PAGELATCH_NL | Identified for informational purposes only. Not supported. Future compatibility isn't guaranteed. |
| <a id="pagelatch_sh"></a>PAGELATCH_SH | Occurs when a task is waiting on a latch for a buffer that isn't in an I/O request. The latch request is in Shared mode, which allows multiple threads to read, but not modify, a buffer (page). For more information, see [Latch Modes](../diagnose-resolve-latch-contention.md#sql-server-latch-modes-and-compatibility). |
| <a id="pagelatch_up"></a>PAGELATCH_UP | Occurs when a task is waiting on a latch for a buffer that isn't in an I/O request. The latch request is in Update mode. Commonly this wait type may be observed when a system page (buffer) like PFS, GAM, SGAM is latched. For more information, see [Latch Modes](../diagnose-resolve-latch-contention.md#sql-server-latch-modes-and-compatibility).<br /><br />For troubleshooting a common scenario with this latch, refer to [Reduce Allocation Contention in SQL Server tempdb database](/troubleshoot/sql/performance/recommendations-reduce-allocation-contention). |
