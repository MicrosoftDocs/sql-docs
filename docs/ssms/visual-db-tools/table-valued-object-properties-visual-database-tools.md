# Table-Valued Object Properties (Visual Database Tools)
[!INCLUDE[SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]
These properties appear in the Properties window when you select a table-valued object in **Query and View Designer**. The table-valued object could be a view, synonym, derived table, or table-valued function. Unless otherwise noted, these properties are read-only in the **Properties** window.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> The properties in this topic are ordered by category rather than alphabet.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu.
