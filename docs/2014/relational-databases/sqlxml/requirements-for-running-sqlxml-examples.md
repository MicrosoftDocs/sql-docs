# Requirements for Running SQLXML Examples
  The [SQLXML 4.0 Programming](sqlxml-4-0-programming-concepts.md) section provides numerous examples. This topic lists requirements for creating working samples from these examples.  
  
 To create working samples using the SQLXML 4.0 examples, you need to have the following installed.  
  
-   The AdventureWorks sample database. For more information, see [AdventureWorks Sample Databases](http://msftdbprodsamples.codeplex.com/).  
  
-   Microsoft [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client. For more information, see [Installing SQL Server Native Client](../native-client/applications/installing-sql-server-native-client.md).  
  
-   MDAC 2.6 or later  
  
 In many examples, templates are used to specify XPath queries against the mapping XSD schema. For more information, see [Using Annotated XSD Schemas in Queries &#40;SQLXML 4.0&#41;](annotated-xsd-schemas/using-annotated-xsd-schemas-in-queries-sqlxml-4-0.md).
