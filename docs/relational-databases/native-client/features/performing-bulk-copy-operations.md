# Performing Bulk Copy Operations in SQL Server Native Client 
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> [!INCLUDE[snac-removed-oledb-and-odbc](../../../includes/snac-removed-oledb-and-odbc.md)]

  The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] bulk copy feature supports the transfer of large amounts of data into or out of a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] table or view. Data can also be transferred out by specifying a SELECT statement. The data can be moved between [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and an operating-system data file, such as an ASCII file. The data file can have different formats; the format is defined to bulk copy in a format file. Optionally, data can be loaded into program variables and transferred to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] using bulk copy functions and methods.  
  
 For a sample application that demonstrates this feature, see [Bulk Copy Data Using IRowsetFastLoad &#40;OLE DB&#41;](../../../relational-databases/native-client-ole-db-how-to/bulk-copy-data-using-irowsetfastload-ole-db.md).  
  
 An application typically uses bulk copy in one of the following ways:  
  
-   Bulk copy from a table, view, or the result set of a Transact-SQL statement into a data file where the data is stored in the same format as the table or view.  
  
     This is called a native-mode data file.  
  
-   Bulk copy from a table, view, or the result set of a Transact-SQL statement into a data file where the data is stored in a format other than the one of the table or view.  
  
     In this case, a separate format file is created that defines the characteristics (data type, position, length, terminator, and so on) of each column as it is stored in the data file. If all columns are converted to character format, the resulting file is called a character-mode data file.  
  
-   Bulk copy from a data file into a table or view.  
  
     If needed, a format file is used to determine the layout of the data file.  
  
-   Load data into program variables, then import the data into a table or view using the bulk copy functions for bulk copying in a row at a time.  
  
 Data files used by bulk copy functions do not have to be created by another bulk copy program. Any other system can generate a data file and format file according to bulk copy definitions; these files can then be used with a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] bulk copy program to import data into [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. For example, you could export data from a spreadsheet in a tab-delimited file, build a format file describing the tab-delimited file, and then use a bulk copy program to quickly import the data into [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Data files generated by bulk copy can also be imported into other applications. For example, you could use bulk copy functions to export data from a table or view into a tab-delimited file that could then be loaded into a spreadsheet.  
  
 Programmers coding applications to use the bulk copy functions should follow the general rules for good bulk copy performance. For more information about support for bulk copy operations in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], see [Bulk Import and Export of Data &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../../relational-databases/import-export/bulk-import-and-export-of-data-sql-server.md).  
  
## Limitations and Restrictions  
 A CLR user-defined type (UDT) must be bound as binary data. Even if a format file specifies SQLCHAR as the data type for a target UDT column, The BCP utility will treat the data as binary.  
  
 Do not use SET FMTONLY OFF with bulk copy operations. SET FMTONLY OFF may cause your bulk copy operation to fail or give unexpected results.  
  
## SQL Server Native Client OLE DB Provider  
 The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider implements two methods for performing bulk copy operations with a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database. The first method involves using the [IRowsetFastLoad](../../../relational-databases/native-client-ole-db-interfaces/irowsetfastload-ole-db.md) interface for memory-based bulk copy operations; and the second involves using the [IBCPSession](../../../relational-databases/native-client-ole-db-interfaces/ibcpsession-ole-db.md) interface for file-based bulk copy operations.  
  
### Using Memory Based Bulk Copy Operations  
 The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider implements the **IRowsetFastLoad** interface to expose support for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] memory-based bulk copy operations. The **IRowsetFastLoad** interface implements the [IRowsetFastLoad::Commit](../../../relational-databases/native-client-ole-db-interfaces/irowsetfastload-commit-ole-db.md) and [IRowsetFastLoad::InsertRow](../../../relational-databases/native-client-ole-db-interfaces/irowsetfastload-insertrow-ole-db.md) methods.  
  
#### Enabling a Session for IRowsetFastLoad  
 The consumer notifies the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider of its need for bulk copy by setting the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider-specific data source property SSPROP_ENABLEFASTLOAD to VARIANT_TRUE. With the property set on the data source, the consumer creates a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider session. The new session allows consumer access to the **IRowsetFastLoad** interface.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If the **IDataInitialize** interface is used for initializing the data source, then it is necessary to set the SSPROP_IRowsetFastLoad property in the *rgPropertySets* parameter of the **IOpenRowset::OpenRowset** method; otherwise, the call to the **OpenRowset** method will return E_NOINTERFACE.  
  
 Enabling a session for bulk copy constrains the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider support for interfaces on the session. A bulk copy-enabled session exposes only the following interfaces:  
  
-   **IDBSchemaRowset**  
  
-   **IGetDataSource**  
  
-   **IOpenRowset**  
  
-   **ISupportErrorInfo**  
  
-   **ITransactionJoin**  
  
 To disable the creation of bulk copy-enabled rowsets and cause the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider session to revert to standard processing, reset SSPROP_ENABLEFASTLOAD to VARIANT_FALSE.  
  
#### IRowsetFastLoad Rowsets  
 The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider bulk copy rowsets are write-only, but they expose interfaces that allow the consumer to determine the structure of a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] table. The following interfaces are exposed on a bulk copy-enabled [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider rowset:  
  
-   **IAccessor**  
  
-   **IColumnsInfo**  
  
-   **IColumnsRowset**  
  
-   **IConvertType**  
  
-   **IRowsetFastLoad**  
  
-   **IRowsetInfo**  
  
-   **ISupportErrorInfo**  
  
 The provider-specific properties SSPROP_FASTLOADOPTIONS, SSPROP_FASTLOADKEEPNULLS, and SSPROP_FASTLOADKEEPIDENTITY control behaviors of a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider bulk-copy rowset. The properties are specified in the *rgProperties* member of an _rgPropertySets_**IOpenRowset**parameter member.  
  
|Property ID|Description|  
|-----------------|-----------------|  
|SSPROP_FASTLOADKEEPIDENTITY|Column: No<br /><br /> R/W: Read/write<br /><br /> Type: VT_BOOL<br /><br /> Default: VARIANT_FALSE<br /><br /> Description: Maintains identity values supplied by the consumer.<br /><br /> VARIANT_FALSE: Values for an identity column in the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] table are generated by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Any value bound for the column is ignored by the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider.<br /><br /> VARIANT_TRUE: The consumer binds an accessor providing a value for a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] identity column. The identity property is not available on columns accepting NULL, so the consumer provides a unique value on each **IRowsetFastLoad::Insert** call.|  
|SSPROP_FASTLOADKEEPNULLS|Column: No<br /><br /> R/W: Read/write<br /><br /> Type: VT_BOOL<br /><br /> Default: VARIANT_FALSE<br /><br /> Description: Maintains NULL for columns with a DEFAULT constraint. Affects only [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] columns that accept NULL and have a DEFAULT constraint applied.<br /><br /> VARIANT_FALSE: [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] inserts the default value for the column when the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider consumer inserts a row containing NULL for the column.<br /><br /> VARIANT_TRUE: [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] inserts NULL for the column value when the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider consumer inserts a row containing NULL for the column.|  
|SSPROP_FASTLOADOPTIONS|Column: No<br /><br /> R/W: Read/write<br /><br /> Type: VT_BSTR<br /><br /> Default: none<br /><br /> Description: This property is the same as the **-h** "*hint*[,...*n*]" option of the **bcp** utility. The following string(s) can be used as option(s) in the bulk copying of data into a table.<br /><br /> **ORDER**(*column*[**ASC** &#124; **DESC**][,...*n*]): Sort order of data in the data file. Bulk copy performance is improved if the data file being loaded is sorted according to the clustered index on the table.<br /><br /> **ROWS_PER_BATCH** = *bb*: Number of rows of data per batch (as *bb*). The server optimizes the bulk load according to the value *bb*. By default, **ROWS_PER_BATCH** is unknown.<br /><br /> **KILOBYTES_PER_BATCH** = *cc*: Number of kilobytes (KB) of data per batch (as cc). By default, **KILOBYTES_PER_BATCH** is unknown.<br /><br /> **TABLOCK**: A table-level lock is acquired for the duration of the bulk copy operation. This option significantly improves performance because holding a lock only for the duration of the bulk copy operation reduces lock contention on the table. A table can be loaded by multiple clients concurrently if the table has no indexes and **TABLOCK** is specified. By default, the locking behavior is determined by the table option **table lock on bulk load**.<br /><br /> **CHECK_CONSTRAINTS**: Any constraints on *table_name* are checked during the bulk copy operation. By default, constraints are ignored.<br /><br /> **FIRE_TRIGGER**: [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] uses row versioning for triggers and stores the row versions in the version store in **tempdb**. Therefore, bulk logging optimizations are available even when triggers are enabled. Before bulk importing a batch with a large number of rows with triggers enabled, you may need to expand the size of **tempdb**.|  
  
### Using File Based Bulk Copy Operations  
 The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider implements the **IBCPSession** interface to expose support for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] file-based bulk copy operations. The **IBCPSession** interface implements the [IBCPSession::BCPColFmt](../../../relational-databases/native-client-ole-db-interfaces/ibcpsession-bcpcolfmt-ole-db.md), [IBCPSession::BCPColumns](../../../relational-databases/native-client-ole-db-interfaces/ibcpsession-bcpcolumns-ole-db.md), [IBCPSession::BCPControl](../../../relational-databases/native-client-ole-db-interfaces/ibcpsession-bcpcontrol-ole-db.md), [IBCPSession::BCPDone](../../../relational-databases/native-client-ole-db-interfaces/ibcpsession-bcpdone-ole-db.md), [IBCPSession::BCPExec](../../../relational-databases/native-client-ole-db-interfaces/ibcpsession-bcpexec-ole-db.md), [IBCPSession::BCPInit](../../../relational-databases/native-client-ole-db-interfaces/ibcpsession-bcpinit-ole-db.md), [IBCPSession::BCPReadFmt](../../../relational-databases/native-client-ole-db-interfaces/ibcpsession-bcpreadfmt-ole-db.md), and [IBCPSession::BCPWriteFmt](../../../relational-databases/native-client-ole-db-interfaces/ibcpsession-bcpwritefmt-ole-db.md)methods.  
  
## SQL Server Native Client ODBC Driver  
 The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client ODBC driver maintains the same support for bulk copy operations that were part of previous versions of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] ODBC driver. For information about bulk copy operations using the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client ODBC driver, see [Performing Bulk Copy Operations &#40;ODBC&#41;](../../../relational-databases/native-client-odbc-bulk-copy-operations/performing-bulk-copy-operations-odbc.md).
