# Working with SSMA for Sybase Console (SybaseToSQL)
[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame_md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Migration Assistant (SSMA), release for Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE), is now accessible through a console application at command line. The script files form the input to the application for executing the commands. As a console application, SSMA enables script-level interfacing, reduces the migration cycle, and scales the migration effort.  
  
This section explains the procedure to migrate the ASE database using the SSMA Console application.
