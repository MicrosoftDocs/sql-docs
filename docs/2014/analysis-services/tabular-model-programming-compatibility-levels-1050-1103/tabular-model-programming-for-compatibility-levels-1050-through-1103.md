# Tabular Model Programming
  Tabular models use relational constructs to model the Analysis Services data used by analytical and reporting applications. These models run on an Analysis Service instance that is configured for tabular mode, using an in-memory analytics engine for storage and fast table scans that aggregate and calculate data as it is requested.  
  
 Programmatically, the objects you work with in AMO, ADOMD.NET, XMLA, or OLE DB are fundamentally the same for both tabular and multidimensional solutions. If the requirements of your custom BI solution are best met by a tabular model database, you can use any of the Analysis Services client libraries and programming interfaces to integrate your application with tabular models on an Analysis Services instance. To query and calculate tabular model data, you can use either embedded MDX or DAX in your code.  
  
 This section provides more information about how you can programmatically work with tabular model entities and their properties.
