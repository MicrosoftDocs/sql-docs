# Advanced Editor

[!INCLUDE[sqlserver-ssis](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver-ssis.md)]


  Use the **Advanced Editor** dialog box to configure properties for the selected [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] object.  
  
 The **Advanced Editor** is available for most [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] objects that have configurable properties. It is the only editor available for those objects that do not expose a custom user interface.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] data flow objects have properties that can be set at the component level, the input and output level, and the input and output column level. The **Advanced Editor** enumerates all the common and custom properties of the selected object and displays them on up to four of the following five tabs as applicable:  
  
-   **Connection Managers** -- use this tab to set connection properties  
  
-   **Component Properties** -- use this tab to set component-level properties  
  
-   **Column Mappings** -- use this tab to map available columns as output columns  
  
-   **Input Columns** -- use this tab to select input columns  
  
-   **Input and Output Properties** -- use this tab to set input and output properties; and to add and remove outputs, select or remove columns for inputs and outputs, and set properties for inputs and outputs  
  
 The properties displayed vary by component. For more information on the properties that may be displayed in the **Advanced Editor**, see the following topics:  
  
-   [Common Properties](./data-flow/set-the-properties-of-a-data-flow-component.md)  
  
-   [Transformation Custom Properties](../integration-services/data-flow/transformations/transformation-custom-properties.md)  
  
-   [Path Properties](./data-flow/integration-services-paths.md)  
  
 For more information about the specific component that you are editing, see the description of the component in the Data Flow Elements section of the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] Objects and Concepts documentation:  
  
-   [Integration Services Transformations](../integration-services/data-flow/transformations/integration-services-transformations.md)
