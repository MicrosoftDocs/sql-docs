  The following properties appear on the **Advanced** tab by default. If custom properties are defined, they also appear on this tab, with their values.  
  
## Options  
 **Clustered**  
 Indicates if this service is installed as a resource of a clustered server.  
  
 **Customer Feedback Reporting**  
 Indicates whether Service Quality Monitoring has been enabled on this service. For more information on Customer Feedback Reporting, search Books Online for the topic, "Error and Usage Report Settings."  
  
 **Data Path**

For more information on Error Reporting, search Books Online for the topic, "Error and Usage Report Settings." To change this value, in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] Object Explorer, right-click your server, click **Properties**, and then click the **Misc. Server Settings** page. The options are presented in the **Information Reporting** area.
