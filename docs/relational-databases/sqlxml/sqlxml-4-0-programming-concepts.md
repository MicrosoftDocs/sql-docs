# SQLXML 4.0 Programming Concepts
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
  SQLXML 3.0 was offered as a Web release to provide additional client-side XML functionality and enhancements to existing features, such as annotated XSD schemas, XML bulk load, Web services (SOAP) support, and updategrams.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../includes/ssversion2005-md.md)] introduced SQLXML 4.0, which continues to deliver the same functionality as SQLXML 3.0 plus additional updates provided to accommodate new features introduced with [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../includes/ssversion2005-md.md)].  
  
 This section provides information about SQLXML 4.0.
