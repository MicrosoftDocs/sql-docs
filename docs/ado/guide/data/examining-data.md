# Examining Data
The [Getting Data](../../../ado/guide/data/getting-data.md) section explained how to retrieve data from a data source as one or more **Recordset** objects. This section will discuss **Recordset** in more detail, including how to navigate through the **Recordset** and view its data.  
  
 **Recordset** supports various [properties and methods](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/recordset-object-properties-methods-and-events.md) for you to navigate and examine data contained within. These features are provider-dependent. Some providers might not support some properties or methods.  
  
 This section contains the following topics.  
  
-   [Current Record and Size of Recordset](../../../ado/guide/data/current-record-and-size-of-recordset.md)  
  
-   [Navigating Through Data](../../../ado/guide/data/navigating-through-data.md)  
  
-   [Understanding Recordset Structure](../../../ado/guide/data/understanding-recordset-structure.md)  
  
-   [Sample Recordset for Examining Data](../../../ado/guide/data/sample-recordset-for-examining-data.md)  
  
-   [Boundaries of a Recordset](../../../ado/guide/data/boundaries-of-a-recordset.md)
