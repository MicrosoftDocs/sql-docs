# Monitor Resource Usage (Performance Monitor)
 [!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-windows-only.md)]

  If you are running Microsoft Windows server operating system, use the Performance Monitor graphical tool to measure the performance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. You can view [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] objects, performance counters, and the behavior of other objects, such as processors, memory, cache, threads, and processes. Each of these objects has an associated set of counters that measure device usage, queue lengths, delays, and other indicators of throughput and internal congestion.  
  
## Benefits of Performance Monitor  
 Performance Monitor can be useful to monitor Windows operating system and [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] counters at the same time to determine any correlation between the performance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and Windows. For example, monitoring the Windows disk input/output (I/O) counters and the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Buffer Manager counters at the same time can reveal the behavior of the entire system.  
  
 Performance Monitor allows you to obtain statistics on current [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] activity and performance. Using Performance Monitor, you can:  
  
-   View data simultaneously from any number of computers.  
  
-   View and change charts to reflect current activity, and show counter values that are updated at a frequency that the user defines.  
  
-   Export data from charts, logs, alert logs, and reports to spreadsheet or database applications for further manipulation and printing.  
  
-   Add system alerts that list an event in the alert log and can notify you by issuing a network alert.  
  
-   Run a predefined application the first time or every time a counter value goes over or under a user-defined value.  
  
-   Create log files that contain data about various objects from different computers.  
  
-   Append to one file selected sections from other existing log files to form a long-term archive.  
  
-   View current-activity reports, or create reports from existing log files.  
  
-   Save individual chart, alert, log, or report settings, or the entire workspace setup for reuse.  
 
## Performance Monitor Performance  
 When you monitor [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and the Microsoft Windows operating system to investigate performance-related issues, concentrate your initial efforts in three main areas:  
  
-   Disk activity  
  
-   Processor utilization  
  
-   Memory usage  
  
 Monitoring a computer on which Performance Monitor is running can affect computer performance slightly. Therefore, either log the Performance Monitor data to another disk (or computer) so that it reduces the effect on the computer being monitored, or run Performance Monitor from a remote computer. Monitor only the counters in which you are interested. If you monitor too many counters, resource usage overhead is added to the monitoring process and affects the performance of the computer that is being monitored.
