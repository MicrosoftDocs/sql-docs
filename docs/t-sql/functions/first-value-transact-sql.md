# FIRST_VALUE (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2012-all-md](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2012-all-md.md)]

  Returns the first value in an ordered set of values in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)].  
  
 ![Topic link icon](../../database-engine/configure-windows/media/topic-link.gif "Topic link icon") [Transact-SQL Syntax Conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
FIRST_VALUE ( [scalar_expression ] )   
    OVER ( [ partition_by_clause ] order_by_clause [ rows_range_clause ] )  
  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *scalar_expression*  
 Is the value to be returned. *scalar_expression* can be a column, subquery, or other arbitrary expression that results in a single value. Other analytic functions are not permitted.  
  
 OVER **(** [ *partition_by_clause* ] *order_by_clause* [ *rows_range_clause* ] **)**  
 *partition_by_clause* divides the result set produced by the FROM clause into partitions to which the function is applied. If not specified, the function treats all rows of the query result set as a single group. *order_by_clause* determines the logical order in which the operation is performed. *order_by_clause* is required. *rows_range_clause* further limits the rows within the partition by specifying start and end points. For more information, see [OVER Clause &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/queries/select-over-clause-transact-sql.md).  
  
## Return Types  
 Is the same type as *scalar_expression*.  
  
## General Remarks  
 FIRST_VALUE is nondeterministic. For more information, see [Deterministic and Nondeterministic Functions](../../relational-databases/user-defined-functions/deterministic-and-nondeterministic-functions.md).  
  
## Examples  
  
### A. Using FIRST_VALUE over a query result set  
 The following example uses FIRST_VALUE to return the name of the product that is the least expensive in a given product category.  
  
```  
USE AdventureWorks2012;  
GO  
SELECT Name, ListPrice,   
       FIRST_VALUE(Name) OVER (ORDER BY ListPrice ASC) AS LeastExpensive   
FROM Production.Product  
WHERE ProductSubcategoryID = 37;  
```  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]  
  
```  
  
Name                    ListPrice             LeastExpensive

```  
  
### B. Using FIRST_VALUE over partitions  
 The following example uses FIRST_VALUE to return the employee with the fewest number of vacation hours compared to other employees with the same job title. The PARTITION BY clause partitions the employees by job title and the FIRST_VALUE function is applied to each partition independently. The ORDER BY clause specified in the OVER clause determines the logical order in which the FIRST_VALUE function is applied to the rows in each partition. The ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING clause specifies the starting point of the window is the first row of each partition.  
  
```  
USE AdventureWorks2012;   
GO  
SELECT JobTitle, LastName, VacationHours,   
       FIRST_VALUE(LastName) OVER (PARTITION BY JobTitle   
                                   ORDER BY VacationHours ASC  
                                   ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING  
                                  ) AS FewestVacationHours  
FROM HumanResources.Employee AS e  
INNER JOIN Person.Person AS p   
    ON e.BusinessEntityID = p.BusinessEntityID  
ORDER BY JobTitle;  
```  
  
 Here is a partial result set.  
  
```  
  
JobTitle                            LastName                  VacationHours FewestVacationHours
