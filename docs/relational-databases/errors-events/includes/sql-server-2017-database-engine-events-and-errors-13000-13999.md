| 13781 | 16 | No | Wrong type for column '%.\*ls': the system-versioned temporal table '%.\*ls' cannot contain large object columns, because it has finite retention and the clustered column store history table '%.\*ls'. |
| 13782 | 16 | No | Cannot create clustered column store index '%.\*ls' on table '%.\*ls' because it contains large object columns and is the history table of temporal table '%.\*ls' that has finite retention. |

| 13900 | 16 | No | Identifier '%.\*ls' in a MATCH clause could not be bound. |
| 13901 | 16 | No | Identifier '%.\*ls' in a MATCH clause is not a node table or an alias for a node table. |
| 13902 | 16 | No | Identifier '%.\*ls' in a MATCH clause is not an edge table or an alias for an edge table. |
| 13903 | 16 | No | Edge table '%.\*ls' used in more than one MATCH pattern. |

| 13907 | 16 | No | Cannot modify permissions for graph column '%.\*s'. |
| 13908 | 16 | No | Cannot access internal graph column '%.\*ls'. |
| 13909 | 16 | No | The internal graph column '%.\*ls' cannot be added to an index; use pseudocolumn '%.\*ls' instead. |

| 13911 | 16 | No | Cannot create a node or edge table as a remote data archive. |
| 13912 | 16 | No | A node or edge table cannot be created as or altered to a temporal table. |
| 13913 | 16 | No | Internal graph columns cannot be altered. |
| 13914 | 16 | No | Cannot create a node or edge table as a temporary table. |
| 13915 | 16 | No | Cannot create a node or edge table as an external table. |
| 13916 | 16 | No | The graph column '%.\*ls' cannot be used as a non-key column in an index. |
| 13917 | 16 | No | After expanding the computed graph column '%.\*ls", the index '%.\*ls' on table '%.\*ls' exceeds the maximum number of columns in the key list. The maximum number of index key columns is %d. |
| 13918 | 16 | No | Adding constraint to column '%.\*s' of a node or edge table is not allowed. |
| 13919 | 16 | No | Identifier '%.\*ls' in a MATCH clause corresponds to a derived table. Derived tables are not supported in MATCH clauses. |
| 13920 | 16 | No | Identifier '%.\*ls' in a MATCH clause is used with a JOIN clause or APPLY operator. JOIN and APPLY are not supported with MATCH clauses. |
| 13921 | 16 | No | JSON data for INSERT/UPDATE of graph pseudocolumn '%.\*ls' is malformed. |
| 13922 | 16 | No | Remote tables are not supported in MATCH clauses. |
| 13923 | 16 | No | Pseudocolumn '%.\*s' is invalid because it references a node or edge table that is not in the current database. |
| 13924 | 16 | No | Select \* is not permitted because it refers to a node or edge table '%.\*s' which is not in the current database. |
| 13925 | 16 | No | Cannot drop or disable index or constraint '%.\*s' because the last unique index or constraint on '%.\*s' cannot be dropped or disabled. |
| 13926 | 16 | No | The use of replication is not supported for node or edge table '%ls'. |
| 13927 | 16 | No | Change Data Capture is not supported for node or edge table '%ls'. |
| 13928 | 16 | No | Use pseudocolumn '%.\*ls' to add a constraint on a node or edge table. |
| 13929 | 16 | No | The pseudocolumn '%.\*ls' cannot be part of an index unless the index is on a node or edge table that contains that pseudocolumn. |
