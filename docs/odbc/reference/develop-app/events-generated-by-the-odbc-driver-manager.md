# Events Generated by the ODBC Driver Manager
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Support for Visual Studio Analyzer was removed beginning in Windows 8 (Visual Studio Analyzer was only included in older versions of Visual Studio.). For an alternative troubleshooting mechanism, use BID tracing.  
  
 Events generated by the ODBC Driver Manager are registered when the Start Visual Studio Analyzer button is clicked. The tool itself offers system-defined events and the ability to create custom events. For more information about events, see the *Visual Studio Analyzer Reference Guide* within the Visual Studio suite of documentation.  
  
|Visual Studio Analyzer event|Description|  
|----------------------------------|-----------------|  
|**Call**|Generated on every ODBC API entry.|  
|**ReturnException**|Generated on every ODBC API return if the return code is SQL_ERROR.|  
|**ReturnNormal**|Generated on every ODBC API return if the return code is not SQL_ERROR.|  
|**Connection Start**|Indicates that a connection started; generated when the ODBC Driver Manager calls the driver's connection APIs.|  
|**Connection Complete**|Indicates that a connection completed; generated when the driver's connection APIs return to the ODBC Driver Manager.|  
|**Disconnect Start**|Generated when the ODBC Driver Manager calls the driver's **SQLDisconnect** function.|  
|**Disconnect Complete**|Generated when the driver's **SQLDisconnect** function returns to the ODBC Driver Manager.|  
|**QuerySend**|Generated when the ODBC Driver Manager calls the driver's **SQLPrepare**, **SQLExecute**, **SQLExecDirect** functions, as well as catalog functions such as **SQLTables** and **SQLColumns**.|  
|**QueryResult**|Generated when the driver returns a result set to the ODBC Driver Manager for functions involving queries.|  
|**TransactionStart**|Generated when an application sets the value of SQL_ATTR_AUTOCOMMIT to SQL_AUTOCOMMIT_OFF, or after an application successfully calls **SQLEndTran**.|  
|**TransactionCommit**|Generated when an application calls **SQLEndTran** to commit a local transaction.|  
|**TransactionRollback**|Generated when an application calls **SQLEndTran** to roll back a local transaction.|  
|**JoinDTC**|Generated when an application joins the Distributed Transaction Coordinator (DTC).|  
|**LeaveDTC**|Generated when an application leaves the Distributed Transaction Coordinator (DTC).|
