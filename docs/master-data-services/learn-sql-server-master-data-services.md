# Learn SQL Server Master Data Services

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly](../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly.md)]

  
  
## Training  
* To explore the new features and capabilities introduced in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent_md](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort_md](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)],try out this [**TechNet virtual lab**](https://vlabs.holsystems.com/vlabs/technet?eng=VLabs&auth=none&src=vlabs&altadd=true&labid=23113&lod=true) (sign-in with your Microsoft account is required).  
* To develop a [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort_md](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] solution to store and manage master lists of geographic data, using the Add-in for Excel and the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm_md](../includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)], try out this [**TechNet virtual lab**](https://vlabs.holsystems.com/vlabs/technet?eng=VLabs&auth=none&src=vlabs&altadd=true&labid=23112&lod=true). You'll create entities and hierarchies, and use [!INCLUDE[ssIS_md](../includes/ssis-md.md)] to populate a dimension table.  
  
## Videos  
* To learn about the new capabilities in the [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent_md](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] release of [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort_md](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)], [**watch this video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKA72FpOVxI).  
  
## Samples  
* To learn more about how you can structure data in [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort_md](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] using models, entities, and hierarchies, try out the sample models that are included when you install [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort_md](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)]. For instructions on deploying the samples, see [Deploy Sample Models and Data](../master-data-services/master-data-services-installation-and-configuration.md#deploySample).   
  
    For information about the [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent_md](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] updates to the sample models, see [SQL Server Samples: Model Deployment Packages](../master-data-services/sql-server-samples-model-deployment-packages-mds.md).  
  
* For a demonstration of how to customize the way that you and your users interact with [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort_md](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)], try out the MDS C# console application samples that are included with the SQL Server samples. You can download the SQL Server samples as a .zip file from this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples).  
  
    The following are the MDS application samples. The SQL Server samples download also includes    readmes that help you get started using the application samples.  
    * Master Data Services Business Rule API Sample  
    * Master Data Services Entity Based Staging API Sample  
    * Master Data Services Master Data API Sample  
    * Master Data Services Metadata API Sample  
    * Master Data Services Security Model Deployment API Sample  
    * Master Data Services Security API Sample
