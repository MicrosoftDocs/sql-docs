# Symmetric Keys on System Databases
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
  This rule checks for user-created symmetric keys in the master, msdb, model, and tempdb databases.  
  
## Best Practices Recommendations  
 Do not create symmetric keys in the system databases.
