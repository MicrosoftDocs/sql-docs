# Save Changes
  Warns you that changes to the items listed will not be saved unless you click **Yes**.  
  
 This dialog box can appear when you are closing solutions, maintenance plans, or other open files.  
  
### To display the Save Changes dialog box  
  
-   With a new file open, on the **File** menu, click **Close**.  
  
 Changes to previously saved items will be saved automatically to their save location in storage. If an item has not yet been saved, the **Save File As** dialog box appears to prompt you for a new save location.  
  
## Options  
 **Save changes to the following items?**  
 Selected items will be saved. Items can be selected and cleared.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  When saving, specify only the object name, not the schema and object name.
