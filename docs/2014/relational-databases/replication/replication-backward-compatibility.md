# Replication Backward Compatibility
  Topics in the backward compatibility section describe changes in behavior between versions of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] replication. It is important to understand backward compatibility if you are upgrading or if you have more than one version of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] in a replication topology.  
  
 [Deprecated Features in SQL Server Replication](deprecated-features-in-sql-server-replication.md)  
 Replication features that have been retained in [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] for backward compatibility, but which will be removed in a future version of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 [Breaking Changes in SQL Server Replication](breaking-changes-in-sql-server-replication.md)  
 Replication feature changes that might require changes to applications.
