##  <a name="BeforeYouBegin"></a> Before You Begin  
  
###  <a name="Restrictions"></a> Limitations and Restrictions  
  
-   Object Explorer only displays the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent node if you have permission to use it.  
  
-   The [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Windows Messenger service must be running to receive net send events.  
  
###  <a name="Security"></a> Security  
  
####  <a name="Permissions"></a> Permissions  
 To perform its functions, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent must be configured to use the credentials of an account that is a member of the **sysadmin** fixed server role in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. The account must have the following Windows permissions:  
  
-   Log on as a service (SeServiceLogonRight)  
  
-   Replace a process-level token (SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege)  
  
-   Bypass traverse checking (SeChangeNotifyPrivilege)  
  
-   Adjust memory quotas for a process (SeIncreaseQuotaPrivilege)  
  
 For more information about the Windows permissions required for the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent service account, see [Select an Account for the SQL Server Agent Service](select-an-account-for-the-sql-server-agent-service.md) and [Configure Windows Service Accounts and Permissions](../../database-engine/configure-windows/configure-windows-service-accounts-and-permissions.md).
