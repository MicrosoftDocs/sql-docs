# View Errors that Occur During Staging (Master Data Services)

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly](../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly.md)]

  In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)], you can view errors that occur during the staging process. In the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] database, there are two views that show errors:  
  
-   stg.viw_name_MemberErrorDetails for leaf or consolidated member updates.  
  
-   stg.viw_name_RelationshipErrorDetails for hierarchy relationship updates.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform this procedure:  
  
-   In the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] database, you must have SELECT permissions to either the stg.viw_name_MemberErrorDetails or stg.viw_name_RelationshipErrorDetails view.  
  
-   You must be a model administrator. For more information, see [Administrators &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../master-data-services/administrators-master-data-services.md).  
  
### To view staging errors  
  
1.  Open [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] and connect to the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)] instance for your [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] database.  
  
2.  Open a new query.  
  
3.  Type the following text, replacing name with the name of your staging table, for example, viw_Product_MemberErrorDetails.  
  
     `SELECT * FROM stg.viw_name_MemberErrorDetails`  
  
4.  Excecute the query. Error details are displayed in the **ErrorDescription** field.
