# Add Articles to and Drop Articles from a Publication
  Initially add articles to a publication when you create it in the New Publication Wizard. For more information about using this wizard, see [Create a Publication](../../../relational-databases/replication/publish/create-a-publication.md).  
  
 After a publication is created, add and delete articles on the **Articles** page of the **Publication Properties - \<Publication>** dialog box. For more information about accessing this dialog box, see [View and Modify Publication Properties](../../../relational-databases/replication/publish/view-and-modify-publication-properties.md). For information about the considerations for adding and dropping articles, see [Add Articles to and Drop Articles from Existing Publications](../../../relational-databases/replication/publish/add-articles-to-and-drop-articles-from-existing-publications.md).  
  
### To add an article after a publication is created  
  
1.  On the **Articles** page of the **Publication Properties - \<Publication>** dialog box, clear the **Show only checked objects in the list** check box. This allows you to see the unpublished objects in the publication database.  
  
2.  Select the check box next to each article you want to add.  
  
3.  [!INCLUDE[clickOK](../../../includes/clickok-md.md)]  
  
### To delete an article  
  
1.  On the **Articles** page of the **Publication Properties - \<Publication>** dialog box, clear the check box next to each article you want to delete.  
  
2.  [!INCLUDE[clickOK](../../../includes/clickok-md.md)]
