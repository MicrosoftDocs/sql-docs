# Building a Knowledge Base

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server - Windows only ASDBMI  ](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

  A knowledge base in [!INCLUDE[ssDQSnoversion](../includes/ssdqsnoversion-md.md)] (DQS) is a repository of knowledge about your data that enables you to understand your data and maintain its integrity. A knowledge base consists of domains, each of which represents the data in a data field. The knowledge base is used by DQS to perform data cleansing and deduplication on a database. To prepare the knowledge base for data cleansing, you can run a computer-assisted analysis of a data sample, and interactively manage values in the domains. DQS enables you to import knowledge, create rules and relationships, change data values directly, and leverage a default database.  
  
## In This Section  
 You can perform the following operations on a knowledge base:  
  
|Operation Description|Topic|  
|-|-|  
|Create a new knowledge base from scratch, from an existing knowledge base, or from a .dqs data file.|[Create a Knowledge Base](../data-quality-services/create-a-knowledge-base.md)|  
|Open an existing knowledge base to perform knowledge discovery, domain management, or add a matching policy.|[Open a Knowledge Base](../data-quality-services/open-a-knowledge-base.md)|  
|Perform management actions on a knowledge base, including opening it, unlocking it, discarding your work on it, renaming it, deleting it, or viewing its properties.|[Manage a Knowledge Base](../data-quality-services/manage-a-knowledge-base.md)|  
|Add knowledge to a knowledge base through knowledge discovery; domain value management; adding a matching policy; importing a knowledge, domain, or values; or using the default knowledge base, DQS Data.|[Adding Knowledge to a Knowledge Base](../data-quality-services/adding-knowledge-to-a-knowledge-base.md)|  
|Analyze a data sample for data quality criteria.|[Perform Knowledge Discovery](../data-quality-services/perform-knowledge-discovery.md)|
