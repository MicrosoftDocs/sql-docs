# Properties (ASSL)
  This reference section contains syntax and usage information for each element that acts as an object property in the Analysis Services Scripting Language (ASSL) schema.  
  
 Although the ASSL schema contains only XML elements, from a developer's point of view, the elements described in this section correspond to properties that describe objects.  
  
 Properties are leaf-level elements in the ASSL schema, and do not have child elements or elements that correspond to properties of their own.  
  
 In a few cases, a leaf-level element in the schema that may appear to be a property is classified as an object because the element's type is an object type. For example, the **Source** of a **Dimension** object is of type **DimensionBinding**.
