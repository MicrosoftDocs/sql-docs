#### Known issues 20.2

| Feature | Details | Workaround |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Analysis Services | When you connect to Analysis Services with Microsoft Entra MFA, if you add a new role or open properties for a role, the message "the identity of the user being added to the role isn't fetched properly" appears. | This error is benign and can be ignored. The error is addressed within the Azure infrastructure, and no updates to SSMS are required. |
| Analysis Services | After adding a new role, or when opening properties for an existing role, you can't use **Search by name or email address** to add a user. | A user can be added with the **Manual Entry** option. |
| Database Designer | Selecting the Design option for a view referencing a table using spatial data causes SSMS to crash. | Use T-SQL to make changes to the view. |
| Database Mirroring | If you launch the Database Mirroring Monitor from the mirrored node, the primary node isn't listed. | Register the mirrored node from Database Mirroring Monitoring, or use SSMS 18.12.1 to monitor from the mirrored node. |
| General SSMS | Import settings from SSMS 17 option not available. | Settings can be imported from SSMS 18. |
| Linked servers | Creating a linked server to Azure SQL Database with [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] selected as Server type connects to the `master` database. | To create a linked server to Azure SQL Database, select **Other data source** for the **Server type**, and select **Microsoft OLE DB Provider for SQL Server** or **Microsoft OLE DB Driver for SQL Server** as the **Provider**. Enter the logical server name in the Data source field and the database name in the Catalog field. |
| Maintenance Plan | Selecting "Contents" after adding a backup file within the Destination pane of the Backup Database Task, causes the dialog to disappear. | Use SSMS 20.1 or SSMS 19.3 to access the Contents dialog. |
| PolyBase | PolyBase node isn't visible in Object Explorer when you connect to [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../includes/sssql22-md.md)]. | Use SSMS 18.12.1. |
| Profiler | The Profiler menu isn't localized. | No current alternative. |
| Replication | If Azure SQL Managed Instance is the publisher and SSMS is running on a machine that isn't in the same virtual network as the publisher, you aren't able to insert a tracer token via Replication Monitor. | To insert tracer tokens, use Replication Monitor in SSMS on a machine that is in the same virtual network as the Azure SQL Managed Instance publisher. |
| Stretch Database | Removed Stretch Database Wizard. | Use T-SQL to configure Stretch Database or use SSMS 18.9.1 or earlier to use the Stretch Database Wizard. |

#### Known issues 19.3

| Feature | Details | Workaround |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Analysis Services | When you connect to Analysis Services with Microsoft Entra MFA, if you add a new role or open properties for a role, the message "the identity of the user being added to the role is not fetched properly" appears. | This error is benign and can be ignored. It will be addressed within the Azure infrastructure soon, and no updates to SSMS are required. |
| Analysis Services | After adding a new role, or when opening properties for an existing role, you can't use **Search by name or email address** to add a user. | A user can be added with the **Manual Entry** option. |
| Database Designer | Selecting the Design option for a view that references a table using spatial data causes SSMS to crash. | Use T-SQL to make changes to the view. |
| Database Mirroring | When you launch the Database Mirroring Monitor from the mirrored node, the primary node isn't listed. | Use SSMS 18.12.1 if you need to monitor mirroring from the mirrored node. |
| General SSMS | Import settings from SSMS 17 option not available. | Settings can be imported from SSMS 18. |
| Link feature for Azure SQL Managed Instance | After you remove an existing mirroring endpoint certificate on SQL Server, link creation through the wizard might fail due to unestablished trust between SQL Server and Azure SQL Managed Instance, even though all checks are successful. | Use PowerShell command `Get-AzSqlInstanceServerTrustCertificate` to check whether SQL Server mirroring endpoint certificate named "<SQL_Server_Instance_Name>" exists in the Azure SQL Managed Instance. If so, use PowerShell command `Remove-AzSqlInstanceServerTrustCertificate` to remove it before a new link creation attempt. |
| Linked servers | Creating a linked server to Azure SQL Database with SQL Server selected as Server type connects to the `master` database. | To create a linked server to Azure SQL Database, select **Other data source** for the **Server type**, and select **Microsoft OLE DB Provider for SQL Server** or **Microsoft OLE DB Driver for SQL Server** as the **Provider**. Enter logical server name in the Data source field, and enter database name in the Catalog field. |
| PolyBase | PolyBase node isn't visible in Object Explorer when connecting to SQL 2022. | Use SSMS 18.12.1. |
| Profiler | The Profiler menu isn't localized. | No current alternative. |
| Replication | If Azure SQL Managed Instance is the publisher and SSMS is running on a machine, which isn't in the same virtual network as the publisher, you aren't able to insert a tracer token via Replication Monitor. | To insert tracer tokens, use Replication Monitor in SSMS on a machine that is in the same virtual network as the Azure SQL Managed Instance publisher. |
| Stretch DB | Removed Stretch DB Wizard. | Use T-SQL to configure Stretch DB or use SSMS 18.9.1 or earlier to use the Stretch DB Wizard. |

#### What's new in 17.9.1

SQL Server utility is no longer available in versions 17.x and newer.

#### Bug fixes in 17.9.1

- Fixed an issue where users could experience their connection being closed and reopened with each query invocation when using "Azure Active Directory - Universal with MFA support" authentication with the SQL query editor. Side effects of the connection closing included global temporary tables being dropped unexpectedly and sometimes a new session ID (SPID) given to the connection.
- Fixed a long outstanding issue where a restore plan would fail to find a restore plan or generate an inefficient one under certain conditions.
- Fixed issue in the "Import Data-tier Application" wizard, which could result in an error when connected to an Azure SQL Database.

> [!NOTE]  
> Non-English localized releases of SSMS 17.x require the [KB 2862966 security update package](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2862966) if installed on: Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2008 R2.

#### Uninstall and reinstall SSMS 17.x

If your SSMS installation is having problems, and a standard uninstall and reinstall doesn't resolve them, you can first try [repairing](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4028054/) the Visual Studio 2015 IsoShell. If repairing the Visual Studio 2015 IsoShell doesn't resolve the problem, the following steps have been found to fix many random issues:

1. Uninstall SSMS the same way you uninstall any application (using **Add or remove programs**).

1. Uninstall Visual Studio 2015 IsoShell **from an elevated cmd prompt**:

   ```cmd
   PUSHD "C:\ProgramData\Package Cache\FE948F0DAB52EB8CB5A740A77D8934B9E1A8E301\redist"
   vs_isoshell.exe /Uninstall /Force /PromptRestart
   ```

1. Uninstall Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable the same way you uninstall any application. Uninstall both x86 and x64 if they're on your computer.

1. Reinstall Visual Studio 2015 IsoShell **from an elevated cmd prompt**:

   ```cmd
   PUSHD "C:\ProgramData\Package Cache\FE948F0DAB52EB8CB5A740A77D8934B9E1A8E301\redist"
   vs_isoshell.exe /PromptRestart
   ```

1. Reinstall SSMS.

1. Upgrade to the [latest version of the Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable](/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist) if you're not currently up to date.

- Context menu for tables momentarily stops responding.

- SSMS occasionally throws exceptions in Activity Monitor and crashes.

- SSMS crashes with the error: "The process was terminated due to an internal error in the .NET Runtime at IP 71AF8579 (71AE0000) with exit code 80131506."
