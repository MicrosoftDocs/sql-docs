# SQLBulkOperations and the Cursor Library
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  This feature will be removed in a future version of Windows. Avoid using this feature in new development work and plan to modify applications that currently use this feature. Microsoft recommends using the driver's cursor functionality.  
  
 The cursor library does not support calling **SQLBulkOperations**. For general information about **SQLBulkOperations**, see [SQLBulkOperations Function](../../../odbc/reference/syntax/sqlbulkoperations-function.md).
