# Reporting Services Extension Library
  The Reporting Services Extension Library is a set of classes, interfaces, and value types that are included in [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)]. This library provides access to system functionality and is designed to be the foundation on which [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] applications can be used to extend [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] components.  
  
## Namespaces  
 The [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] extension library provides the following namespaces.  
  
 <xref:Microsoft.ReportingServices.DataProcessing>  
 Contains classes and interfaces that enable you to build components that extend the data processing capability of [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 <xref:Microsoft.ReportingServices.Interfaces>  
 Contains classes and interfaces that enable you to construct and send custom notifications to users through your own delivery extensions, and to build custom security extensions for [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 `Microsoft.ReportingServices.ReportRendering`  
 Contains classes and interfaces that enable you to extending the rendering capabilities of [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)]. Using the members of this namespace along with members of the <xref:Microsoft.ReportingServices.Interfaces> namespace, you can build your own, custom rendering extensions for [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)].
