# azdata bdc rotate

Applies to [!INCLUDE [azure-data-cli-azdata](../../includes/azure-data-cli-azdata.md)]

This command rotates the passwords of autogenerated AD accounts in a big data cluster. For more information, see [AD password rotation overview](../../big-data-cluster/active-directory-password-rotation.md). You can add this command to your automation scripts or pipelines as part of the security hardening process.

This feature for rotation of passwords for autogenerated AD objects was introduced with SQL Server Big Data Clusters CU13. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `azdata bdc rotate` command rotates passwords for autogenerated AD objects only. The `azdata bdc rotate` command does not rotate the password for the AD for big data cluster domain service account (DSA) created manually while performing a big data cluster AD-integrated deployment. For more information, see [big data cluster AD integrated deployment](../../big-data-cluster/active-directory-prerequisites.md).
