# New to Linux resources for SQL users

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server - Linux](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-linux.md)]

This article is intended to provide a learning path through an introduction of Linux concepts. Use the sections in the article as a guided learning path to familiarize yourself with the Linux environment.

This is not intended to be a comprehensive list but instead provides the bare minimum you need to help you administer and navigate your [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on Linux environment. See the [full list of tutorials](https://www.linux.org/forums/linux-beginner-tutorials.123/) to learn more.

## What is Linux?

The [What is Linux](https://www.linux.org/threads/what-is-linux.4106/) module introduces the history of Linux as an operating system. The module explains *the Kernel* and where Linux is today. This tutorial serves as an introduction to Linux, helping you get started.

## Select a distribution

After you know the history of Linux, decide which [distribution of Linux](https://www.linux.org/threads/selecting-a-linux-distribution.4117/) best suits your business needs. [SQL Server is supported](sql-server-linux-release-notes-2019.md#supported-platforms) on various distributions such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), and Ubuntu.

## Get around directories

After you have chosen the appropriate distribution of Linux, familiarize yourself with [getting around Linux directories](https://www.linux.org/threads/getting-around-in-linux-directories.4120/).

This module will help you answer the following questions:

- How to navigate between different files
- How to identify a file from a directory
- Identify different directories

## Install new software

Next, learn how to [install new software](https://www.linux.org/threads/installing-new-software-debian-red-hat-slackware.4119/) on your new Linux operating system. This module details installing new software to the Debian and Red Hat Linux operating systems.

## Root versus system user

Understand user permissions, and the difference between a [root user and a system user](https://www.linux.org/threads/when-to-work-as-root-when-to-work-as-a-system-user.4136/). This module helps you decide which user permissions are appropriate to use for which scenario.

## File system and permissions

After you're familiar with recognizing different users and groups in Linux, learn how you can change ownership and file permissions on different files in Linux operating systems using the [chown (change ownership)](https://www.linux.org/threads/file-permisions-chown.4125/) and [chmod (change permissions)](https://www.linux.org/threads/file-permissions-chmod.4124) commands.

## Commands for system administration

Introduce yourself to the [frequently used commands](https://www.linux.org/threads/commands-for-system-administration.4126/) system administrators rely on to control their Linux operating systems. These commands include: `df`, `du`, `TOP`, `ps`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `rm`, and `mv`.
