# Other Ways of Viewing the Code Window
  The Code Window can be configured to display multiple code windows in several ways.  
  
## Using Multiple Code Windows  
  
#### To view and manipulate multiple code windows at once  
  
1.  On the **SQL Editor** toolbar, click **New Query** to open a second Query Editor window.  
  
2.  To see two code windows at once, right-click the title bar of the Query Editor and select **New Horizontal Tab Group**. The two query windows appear in horizontal panes.  
  
3.  Click in the upper Query Editor window to make it active, and then click **New Query** to open a third query window. It appears as a tab in the upper window.  
  
4.  On the **Window** menu, click **Move to Next Tab Group**. The third window moves to the lower tab group. By using these options, you can configure the windows in a variety of ways.  
  
5.  Close the second and third query windows.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  To view the Query Editor in full-screen mode, click anywhere in the Query Editor window, and then press SHIFT+ALT+ENTER.
