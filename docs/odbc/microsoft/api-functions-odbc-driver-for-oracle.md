# API Functions (ODBC Driver for Oracle)
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  This feature will be removed in a future version of Windows. Avoid using this feature in new development work, and plan to modify applications that currently use this feature. Instead, use the ODBC driver provided by Oracle.  
  
 The Microsoft ODBC Driver for Oracle supports the Core Level, Level 1, and Level 2 API functions. These functions are listed in [ODBC Conformance Levels](../../odbc/microsoft/odbc-driver-for-oracle-conformance-levels.md).  
  
-   [Core Level Interface](../../odbc/microsoft/core-level-api-functions-odbc-driver-for-oracle.md) (CLI) conformance provides features defined in the ISO CLI specification and the mandatory features defined in the Open Group CLI specification.  
  
-   [Level 1](../../odbc/microsoft/level-1-api-functions-odbc-driver-for-oracle.md) conformance provides Core Level Interface functionality as well as additional features such as transactions.  
  
-   [Level 2](../../odbc/microsoft/level-2-api-functions-odbc-driver-for-oracle.md) conformance provides Level 1 functionality as well as additional features such as bookmarks, dynamic parameters, and asynchronous execution of ODBC functions.
