# Create a Master Data Services Database

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly.md)]

  Create a [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] database when you need a new database to support the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../../includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)] web application and [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] web service.  
  
## Prerequisites  
  
-   For information about the requirements for the computer that hosts the database, see [Database Requirements &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../../master-data-services/install-windows/database-requirements-master-data-services.md).  
  
### To create a Master Data Services database  
  
1.  Open [!INCLUDE[ssMDScfgmgr](../../includes/ssmdscfgmgr-md.md)].  
  
2.  In the left pane, click **Database Configuration**.  
  
3.  On the **Database Configuration** page, click **Create Database**.  
  
4.  Complete the **Create Database** wizard to create and configure the database. For information about the user interface (UI) options in the wizard, see [Create Database Wizard &#40;Master Data Services Configuration Manager&#41;](../../master-data-services/create-database-wizard-master-data-services-configuration-manager.md).  
  
## Next Steps  
  
-   Configure system settings for the database and web application. For more information, see [System Settings &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../../master-data-services/system-settings-master-data-services.md).  
  
-   Create a [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../../includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)] web application to associate with this database. For more information, see [Create a Master Data Manager Web Application &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../../master-data-services/install-windows/create-a-master-data-manager-web-application-master-data-services.md).  
  
-   Configure a maintenance plan to back up the database and transaction logs. For more information, see [Database Requirements &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../../master-data-services/install-windows/database-requirements-master-data-services.md).
