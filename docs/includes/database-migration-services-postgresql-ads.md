The Azure PostgreSQL migration extension for Azure Data Studio enables you to assess and get the right-sized Azure recommendations.

The key benefits of using the Azure PostgreSQL migration extension for Azure Data Studio are:

- A responsive user interface provides you with an end-to-end migration experience that starts with a migration readiness assessment, SKU recommendation (based on performance data).
- An enhanced assessment mechanism can evaluate PostgreSQL instances, identifying databases ready for migration to the Azure Database for PostgreSQL - flexible server targets.
- An SKU recommendation engine that collects performance data from the source PostgreSQL instance, generating right-sized SKU recommendations based on your Azure Database for PostgreSQL - flexible server target.
