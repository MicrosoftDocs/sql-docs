# Setting the Url Property of the Web Service
  At any time in your [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] applications, you can modify the base URL of the Report Server Web service to which your application is currently directed. To do this, simply set the **Url** property of the service object. For example:  
  
```vb  
Dim rs As New ReportingService2010()  
rs.Credentials = System.Net.CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials  
rs.Url = "http://<Server Name>/reportserver/ReportService2010.asmx"  
```  
  
```csharp  
ReportingService2010 service = new ReportingService2010();  
rs.Credentials = System.Net.CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials;  
rs.Url = "http://<Server Name>/reportserver/ReportService2010.asmx";  
```  
  
 The following example retrieves a report definition from one report server and uses that definition to create an identical report on a different report server:  
  
```vb  
Imports System  
Imports System.Web.Services.Protocols  
  
Class Sample  
   Public Shared Sub Main()  
      Dim rs As New ReportingService2010()  
      rs.Credentials = System.Net.CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials  
      ' Set the base Web service URL of the source server  
      rs.Url = "http://<Server Name>/reportserver/ReportService2010.asmx"  
  
      Dim reportName As String = "/SampleReports/Company Sales"  
      Dim reportDefinition As Byte() = Nothing  
  
      Try  
         ' Get the report definition of a report on a source server  
         reportDefinition = rs.GetItemDefinition(reportName)  
         ' Set the base Web service URL of the destination server  
         rs.Url = "http://<Server Name>/reportserver/ReportService2010.asmx"  
         ' Create a copy of the report on the destination server  
         Dim warnings As Warning() = {}  
         rs.CreateCatalogItem("Report", "Company Sales Copy", "/", False, reportDefinition, Nothing, warnings)        
      Catch e As SoapException  
         Console.WriteLine(e.Detail.InnerXml.ToString())  
      End Try  
   End Sub 'Main  
End Class 'Sample  
```  
  
```csharp  
using System;  
using System.Web.Services.Protocols;  
  
class Sample  
{  
   public static void Main()  
   {  
      ReportingService2010 rs = new ReportingService2010();  
      rs.Credentials = System.Net.CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials;  
      // Set the base Web service URL of the source server  
      rs.Url = "http://<Server Name>/reportserver/reportservice2010.asmx";  
  
      string reportName = "/SampleReports/Company Sales";  
      byte[] reportDefinition = null;  
  
      try  
      {  
         reportDefinition = rs.GetItemDefinition(reportName);  
         // Set the base Web service URL of the destination server  
         rs.Url = "http://<Server Name>/reportserver/ReportService2010.asmx";  
         // Create a copy of the report on the destination server  
         Warning[] warnings = {};  
         rs.CreateCatalogItem("Report", "Company Sales Copy", "/", false, reportDefinition, null, out warnings);  
      }  
  
      catch (SoapException e)  
      {  
         Console.WriteLine(e.Detail.InnerXml.ToString());   
      }  
   }  
}  
```
