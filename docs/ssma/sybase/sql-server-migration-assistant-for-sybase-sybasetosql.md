# SQL Server Migration Assistant for Sybase (SybaseToSQL)

[!INCLUDE [msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE) is a tool for migrating ASE databases to [!INCLUDE [sssql11-md](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../../includes/sssql22-md.md)] on Windows and Linux, or [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)]. SSMA for ASE converts ASE database objects to [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or Azure SQL objects, loads those objects into [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or Azure SQL, and then migrates data from ASE to [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or Azure SQL.

This documentation introduces you to SSMA for Sybase and provides step-by-step instructions for migrating ASE databases to [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or Azure SQL Database and information about issues that might occur after migration.
