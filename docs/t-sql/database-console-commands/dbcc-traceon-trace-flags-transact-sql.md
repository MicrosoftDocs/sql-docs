# DBCC TRACEON - Trace Flags (Transact-SQL)

[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss-asdmi-md](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]

Trace flags are used to set specific server characteristics or to alter a particular behavior. For example, Trace Flag 3226 is a commonly used startup trace flag that suppresses successful backup messages in the error log. Trace flags are frequently used to diagnose performance issues or to debug stored procedures or complex computer systems, but they may also be recommended by Microsoft Support to address behavior that is negatively impacting a specific workload.

All documented trace flags and those recommended by Microsoft Support are fully supported in a production environment when used as directed. Trace flags in this list may have additional considerations regarding their particular usage, so it is advisable to carefully review all the recommendations given here and/or by your support engineer. Also, as with any configuration change in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], it is always best to thoroughly test the flag in a non-production environment before deploying.

## Remarks

 In [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], there are three scopes at which trace flags can work: query, session, and global. Query trace flags are active for the context of a specific query. Session trace flags are active for a connection and are visible only to that connection. Global trace flags are set at the server level and are visible to every connection on the server. Some flags can only be enabled as global, and some can be enabled at either global or session scope.

 The following rules apply:

- A global trace flag must be enabled globally. Otherwise, the trace flag has no effect. We recommend that you enable global trace flags at startup, by using the `-T` command line option on Windows, or using **mssql-conf** [on Linux](../../linux/sql-server-linux-configure-mssql-conf.md). This ensures the trace flag remains active after a server restart. Restart SQL Server for the trace flag to take effect.

- If a trace flag has either global, session or query scope, it can be enabled with the appropriate scope. A trace flag that is enabled at the session level never affects another session, and the effect of the trace flag is lost when the SPID that opened the session signs out.

Trace flags are set ON or OFF by using either of the following methods:

- Using the `DBCC TRACEON` and `DBCC TRACEOFF` commands.

  For example, to enable the 2528 trace flag globally, use [DBCC TRACEON](../../t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-traceon-transact-sql.md) with the `-1` argument: `DBCC TRACEON (2528, -1)`. The effect of enabling a global trace flag with `DBCC TRACEON` is lost on server restart. To turn off a global trace flag, use [DBCC TRACEOFF](../../t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-traceoff-transact-sql.md) with the `-1` argument.

- Using the `-T` startup option to specify that the trace flag is set on during startup.

  The `-T` startup option enables a trace flag globally. You can't enable a session-level trace flag by using a startup option. This ensures the trace flag remains active after a server restart. For more information about startup options, see [Database Engine Service Startup Options](../../database-engine/configure-windows/database-engine-service-startup-options.md).

- At the query level, by using the QUERYTRACEON [query hint](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2801413). The QUERYTRACEON option is only supported for Query Optimizer trace flags documented in the table below.

Use the `DBCC TRACESTATUS` command to determine which trace flags are currently active.

## Examples

The following example sets Trace Flag 3205 on for all sessions at the server level by using `DBCC TRACEON`.

```sql
DBCC TRACEON (3205, -1);
```

You can enable all plan-affecting hotfixes controlled by trace flags 4199 and 4137 for a particular query.

```sql
SELECT x FROM correlated WHERE f1 = 0 AND f2 = 1 OPTION (QUERYTRACEON 4199, QUERYTRACEON 4137);
```

## Trace flags

The following table lists and describes the trace flags that are available in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].

Azure SQL Managed Instance supports the following global Trace Flags: 460, 2301, 2389, 2390, 2453, 2467, 7471, 8207, 9389, 10316, and 11024. Session trace-flags aren't yet supported in SQL Managed Instance.

Some trace flags were introduced in specific [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] versions. For more information on the applicable version, see the Microsoft Support article associated with a specific trace flag.

Trace flag behavior may not be supported in future releases of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].

Тrace flags can be referenced directly in the table via a bookmark that you can add to the end of the URL, using this format #tfNNNN. For example, to jump directly to Trace Flag 1118 in the table, use `dbcc-traceon-trace-flags-transact-sql#tf1118`.

| Trace flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| <a id="tf101"></a>**101** | Increases the verboseness of the merge replication agent logging.<br /><br />**Important:** Trace Flag 101 can only be enabled for the [Replication Merge Agent](../../relational-databases/replication/agents/replication-merge-agent.md) using the `-T` option when executing **replmerg.exe** from the command prompt.<br /><br />**Warning:** Trace Flag 101 isn't meant to be enabled continuously in a production environment, but only for time-limited troubleshooting purposes. For more information, see an archived version of [KB2892633](https://mskb.pkisolutions.com/kb/2892633).<br /><br />**Scope:** Replication Merge Agent only. |
| <a id="tf102"></a>**102** | Increases the verboseness of the merge replication agent logging and directs it to the *\<Distribution server>..msmerge_history* table.<br /><br />**Important:** Trace Flag 102 can only be enabled for the [Replication Merge Agent](../../relational-databases/replication/agents/replication-merge-agent.md) using the `-T` option when executing **replmerg.exe** from the command prompt.<br /><br />**Warning:** Trace Flag 102 isn't meant to be enabled continuously in a production environment, but only for time-limited troubleshooting purposes. For more information, see an archived version of [KB2892633](https://mskb.pkisolutions.com/kb/2892633).<br /><br />**Scope:** Replication Merge Agent only. |
| <a id="tf139"></a>**139** | Forces correct conversion semantics in the scope of DBCC check commands like [DBCC CHECKDB](../../t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-checkdb-transact-sql.md), [DBCC CHECKTABLE](../../t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-checktable-transact-sql.md) and [DBCC CHECKCONSTRAINTS](../../t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-checkconstraints-transact-sql.md), when analyzing the improved precision and conversion logic introduced with compatibility level 130 for specific data types, on a database that has a lower compatibility level. For more information, see [KB4010261](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/4010261).<br /><br />**Note:** This trace flag applies to [!INCLUDE[sssql16-md](../../includes/sssql16-md.md)] RTM CU 3, [!INCLUDE[sssql16-md](../../includes/sssql16-md.md)] Service Pack 1 and later.<br /><br />**Warning:** Trace Flag 139 isn't meant to be enabled continuously in a production environment, and should be used for the sole purpose of performing database validation checks described in [KB4010261](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/4010261). It should be immediately disabled after validation checks are completed.<br /><br />**Scope:** Global only. |
| <a id="tf174"></a>**174** | Increases the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] plan cache bucket count from 40,009 to 160,001 on 64-bit systems. For more information, see [KB3026083](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3026083).<br /><br />**Note:** Ensure that you thoroughly test this option, before rolling it into a production environment.<br /><br />**Scope:** Global only. |
| <a id="tf176"></a>**176** | Enables a fix to address errors when rebuilding partitions online for tables that contain a computed partitioning column. For more information, see [KB3213683](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3213683) and [KB4541096](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/4541096).<br /><br />**Scope:** Global or session. |
| <a id="tf205"></a>**205** | Reports to the error log when a statistics-dependent stored procedure is being recompiled as a result of auto-update statistics. For more information, see an archived version of [KB195565](https://mskb.pkisolutions.com/kb/195565).<br /><br />**Note:** This trace flag requires trace flag [3605](#3605) to be enabled.<br /><br />**Scope:** Global only. |
| <a id="tf260"></a>**260** | Prints versioning information about extended stored procedure dynamic-link libraries (DLLs). For more information about `GetXpVersion()`, see [Creating Extended Stored Procedures](../../relational-databases/extended-stored-procedures-programming/creating-extended-stored-procedures.md).<br /><br />**Scope:** Global or session. |
| <a id="tf272"></a>**272** | Disables identity pre-allocation to avoid gaps in the values of an identity column in cases where the server restarts unexpectedly or fails over to a secondary server. Identity caching is used to improve INSERT performance on tables with identity columns.<br /><br />**Note:** Starting with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL17](../../includes/sssql17-md.md)], to accomplish this at the database level, see the IDENTITY_CACHE option in [ALTER DATABASE SCOPED CONFIGURATION (Transact-SQL)](../../t-sql/statements/alter-database-scoped-configuration-transact-sql.md).<br /><br />**Scope:** Global only. |
| <a id="tf460"></a>**460** | Replaces data truncation message ID [8152](../../relational-databases/errors-events/database-engine-events-and-errors.md#errors-8000-to-8999) with message ID [2628](../../relational-databases/errors-events/database-engine-events-and-errors.md#errors-2000-to-2999). For more information, see [KB4468101](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/4468101).<br /><br />Starting with [!INCLUDE[sql-server-2019](../../includes/sssql19-md.md)], to accomplish this at the database level, see the VERBOSE_TRUNCATION_WARNINGS option in [ALTER DATABASE SCOPED CONFIGURATION (Transact-SQL)](../../t-sql/statements/alter-database-scoped-configuration-transact-sql.md).<br /><br />**Note:** This trace flag applies to [!INCLUDE[ssSQL17](../../includes/sssql17-md.md)] CU 12 and later.<br /><br />**Note:** Starting with database compatibility level 150, message ID 2628 is the default and this trace flag has no effect.<br /><br />**Scope:** Global or session. |
| <a id="tf610"></a>**610** | Controls minimally logged inserts into indexed tables. This trace flag isn't required starting SQL Server 2016 as minimal logging is turned on by default for indexed tables. In [!INCLUDE[sssql16-md](../../includes/sssql16-md.md)], when the bulk load operation causes a new page to be allocated, all of the rows sequentially filling that new page are minimally logged if all the other pre-requisites for minimal logging are met. Rows inserted into existing pages (no new page allocation) to maintain index order are still fully logged, as are rows that are moved as a result of page splits during the load.<br /><br />It is also important to have ALLOW_PAGE_LOCKS turned ON for indexes (which is ON by default) for minimal logging operation to work as page locks are acquired during allocation and thereby only page or extent allocations are logged. For more information, see [Data Loading Performance Guide](/previous-versions/sql/sql-server-2008/dd425070(v=sql.100)).<br /><br />**Scope:** Global or session. |
| <a id="tf634"></a>**634** | Disables the background columnstore compression task. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] periodically runs the Tuple Mover background task that compresses columnstore index rowgroups with uncompressed data, one such rowgroup at a time.<br /><br />Columnstore compression improves query performance but also consumes system resources. You can control the timing of columnstore compression manually, by disabling the background compression task with Trace Flag 634, and then explicitly invoking ALTER INDEX...REORGANIZE or ALTER INDEX...REBUILD at the time of your choice.<br /><br />**Scope:** Global only. |
| <a id="tf652"></a>**652** | Disables page pre-fetching scans. If you turn on Trace Flag 652, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] no longer brings database pages into the buffer pool before these database pages are consumed by the scans. As a result, queries that benefit from the page pre-fetching feature exhibit lower performance.<br /><br />**Scope:** Global or session. |
| <a id="tf661"></a>**661** | Disables the ghost record removal process. Trace Flag 661 disables the ghost record removal process. A ghost record is the result of a delete operation. When you delete a record, the deleted record is kept as a ghost record. Later, the deleted record is purged by the ghost record removal process. When you disable this process, the deleted record isn't purged. Therefore, the space that the deleted record consumes isn't freed. This behavior affects space consumption and the performance of scan operations. For more information, review the [Ghost cleanup process guide](../../relational-databases/ghost-record-cleanup-process-guide.md).<br /><br />**Scope:** Global only. |
| <a id="tf692"></a>**692** | Disables fast inserts while bulk loading data into heap or clustered index. Starting [!INCLUDE[sssql16-md](../../includes/sssql16-md.md)], fast inserts is enabled by default, using minimal logging when database is in simple or bulk logged recovery model to optimize insert performance for records inserted into new pages. With fast inserts, each bulk load batch acquires new extent(s) bypassing the allocation lookup for existing extent with available free space to optimize insert performance.<br /><br />With fast inserts, bulk loads with small batch sizes can lead to increased unused space consumed by objects hence it is recommended to use large batchsize for each batch to fill the extent completely. If increasing batchsize isn't feasible, this trace flag can help reduce unused space reserved at the expense of performance.<br /><br />**Note:** This trace flag applies to [!INCLUDE[sssql16-md](../../includes/sssql16-md.md)] and later.<br /><br />**Scope:** Global or session. |
| <a id="tf715"></a>**715** | Enables table lock for bulk load operations into a heap with no nonclustered indexes. When this trace flag is enabled, bulk load operations acquire bulk update (BU) locks when bulk copying data into a table. Bulk update (BU) locks allow multiple threads to bulk load data concurrently into the same table, while preventing other processes that aren't bulk loading data from accessing the table.<br /><br />The behavior is similar to when the user explicitly specifies TABLOCK hint while performing bulk load, or when the sp_tableoption table lock on bulk load is enabled for a given table. However, when this trace flag is enabled, this behavior becomes default without any query or database changes.<br /><br />**Scope:** Global or session. |
|<a name="tf809"></a>**809**|Enables what is referred to as _Direct Write_ behavior for the [Hybrid buffer pool](../../database-engine/configure-windows/hybrid-buffer-pool.md). This mode requires that [persisted log buffer](../../relational-databases/databases/add-persisted-log-buffer.md) be enabled in the same database as hybrid buffer pool. `Direct Write` allows the Hybrid buffer pool to serve as a cache for both dirty and clean pages, reducing the workload demands on the DRAM buffer pools. This optional but recommended behavior was introduced in [!INCLUDE[sssql22-md](../../includes/sssql22-md.md)].
| <a id="tf818"></a>**818** | Enables additional I/O diagnostics to check for Lost Write or Stale Read conditions during file I/O operations. Trace Flag 818 enables an in-memory ring buffer that is used for tracking the last 2,048 successful write operations that are performed by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], not including sort and workfile I/Os. When errors such as Error 605, 823, or 3448 occur, the incoming buffer's log sequence number (LSN) value is compared to the recent write list. If the LSN that is retrieved is older than the one specified during the write operation, a new error message is logged in the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] error log. For more information, see [KB826433](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/826433).<br /><br />**Note:** Starting with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL17](../../includes/sssql17-md.md)] this trace flag has no effect.<br /><br />**Scope:** Global only. |
| <a id="tf830"></a>**830** | Disables detection and reporting of I/O requests that take a very long time to complete. By default [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] uses a mechanism to detect read and write I/O requests that take a long time (typically longer than 15 seconds). This trace flag disables this detection. For more information, see [MSSQLSERVER_833](../../relational-databases/errors-events/mssqlserver-833-database-engine-error.md)<br /><br />**Note:** It isn't recommended that you enable this trace flag because you may decrease your ability to detect I/O issues on the system.<br /><br />**Scope:** Global only. |
| <a id="tf834"></a>**834** | Uses large-page allocations for the buffer pool, columnstore, and in-memory tables. The large page size varies depending on the hardware platform, but the page size may be from 2 MB to 16 MB. Large pages are allocated at startup and are kept throughout the lifetime of the process. Trace Flag 834 improves performance by increasing the efficiency of the translation look-aside buffer (TLB) in the CPU. In other words, Trace Flag 834 increases the efficiency of managing physical to virtual memory address translation that is performed by memory management hardware. For information on SQL Server and Large Pages, review the following [blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/sql-server-support/sql-server-and-large-pages-explained-8230/ba-p/315787).<br /><br />**Note:** Trace Flag 834 applies only to 64-bit versions of SQL Server. You must have the Lock pages in memory user right to turn on trace flag 834. You can turn on trace flag 834 only at startup. Trace Flag 834 may prevent the server from starting if memory is fragmented and if large pages can't be allocated. Therefore, trace flag 834 is best suited for servers that are dedicated to SQL Server.<br /><br />**Note:** When enabled, the large-page memory model pre-allocates all SQLOS memory at instance startup and doesn't return that memory to the OS.<br /><br />**Note:** If you are using the Columnstore Index feature of [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] and later, we don't recommend turning on trace flag 834. For more information, see [KB3210239](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3210239). If using [!INCLUDE[sql-server-2019](../../includes/sssql19-md.md)] and columnstore, see trace flag [876](#876) instead.<br /><br />**Scope:** Global only. |
| <a id="tf836"></a>**836** | Use the max server memory option for the buffer pool. Trace Flag 836 causes SQL Server to size the buffer pool at startup based on the value of the max server memory option instead of based on the total physical memory. You can use trace flag 836 to reduce the number of buffer descriptors that are allocated at startup in 32-bit Address Windowing Extensions (AWE) mode.<br /><br />**Note:** Trace Flag 836 applies only to 32-bit versions of SQL Server that have the AWE allocation enabled. You can turn on trace flag 836 only at startup.<br /><br />**Scope:** Global only. |
| <a id="tf845"></a>**845** | Enables locked pages on Standard SKUs of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], when the service account for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] has the Lock Pages in Memory privilege enabled. For more information, see [KB970070](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/970070) and [Server Memory Server Configuration Options](../../database-engine/configure-windows/server-memory-server-configuration-options.md#lock-pages-in-memory-lpim).<br /><br />**Note:** Starting with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] this behavior is enabled by default for Standard SKUs, and trace flag 845 must not be used.<br /><br />**Scope:** Global only. |
| <a id="tf876"></a>**876** | <a id="876"></a>Uses large-page allocations for columnstore.<br /><br />**Note:** Unlike trace flag 834, using trace flag 876 doesn't pre-allocate SQLOS memory at instance startup, and unused memory can be released.<br /><br />**Note:** This trace flag applies to [!INCLUDE[sql-server-2019](../../includes/sssql19-md.md)] and later.<br /><br />**Note:** Ensure that you thoroughly test this option, before rolling it into a production environment.<br /><br />**Scope:** Global only. |
| <a id="tf890"></a>**890** | <a id="890"></a>Suppress long buffer pool scan complete messages ([error 898](../../relational-databases/errors-events/mssqlserver-898-database-engine-error.md)) in the error log. For more information on buffer pool scan and the message that is logged in the error log, see [Operations that trigger a buffer pool scan may run slowly on large-memory computers](/troubleshoot/sql/performance/buffer-pool-scan-runs-slowly-large-memory-machines).<br /><br />**Note:** Starting with [!INCLUDE[sssql17-md](../../includes/sssql17-md.md)]<br /><br />**Scope:** Global only. |
| <a id="tf902"></a>**902** | Bypasses execution of database upgrade script when installing a Cumulative Update or Service Pack. If you encounter an error during script upgrade mode, it is recommended to contact Microsoft SQL Customer Service and Support (CSS) for further guidance. For more information, see [KB2163980](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2163980).<br /><br />**Warning:** This trace flag is meant for troubleshooting of failed updates during script upgrade mode, and it isn't supported to run it continuously in a production environment. Database upgrade scripts need to execute successfully for a complete install of Cumulative Updates and Service Packs. Not doing so can cause unexpected issues with your [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance.<br /><br />**Scope:** Global only. |
| <a id="tf1117"></a>**1117** | When a file in the filegroup meets the autogrow threshold, all files in the filegroup grow. This trace flag affects all databases. It is recommended only if in every database it is safe to grow all files in a filegroup by the same amount.<br /><br />**Note:** Starting with [!INCLUDE[sssql16-md](../../includes/sssql16-md.md)] this behavior is controlled by the AUTOGROW_SINGLE_FILE and AUTOGROW_ALL_FILES option of ALTER DATABASE, and Trace Flag 1117 has no effect. For more information, see [ALTER DATABASE File and Filegroup Options (Transact-SQL)](../../t-sql/statements/alter-database-transact-sql-file-and-filegroup-options.md).<br /><br />**Scope:** Global only. |
| <a id="tf1118"></a>**1118** | Forces page allocations on uniform extents instead of mixed extents, reducing contention on the SGAM page. When a new object is created, by default, the first eight pages are allocated from different extents (mixed extents). Afterwards, when more pages are needed, those are allocated from that same extent (uniform extent). The SGAM page is used to track these mixed extents, so can quickly become a bottleneck when numerous mixed page allocations are occurring. This trace flag allocates all eight pages from the same extent when creating new objects, minimizing the need to scan the SGAM page. For more information, see [KB328551](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/328551).<br /><br />**Note:** Starting with [!INCLUDE[sssql16-md](../../includes/sssql16-md.md)] this behavior is controlled by the SET MIXED_PAGE_ALLOCATION option of ALTER DATABASE, and Trace Flag 1118 has no effect. For more information, see [ALTER DATABASE SET Options (Transact-SQL)](../../t-sql/statements/alter-database-transact-sql-set-options.md).<br /><br />**Scope:** Global only. |
| <a id="tf1204"></a>**1204** | Returns the resources and types of locks participating in a deadlock and also the current command affected. For more information about deadlocks, see the [Transaction Locking and Row Versioning Guide](../../relational-databases/sql-server-transaction-locking-and-row-versioning-guide.md#deadlocks).<br /><br />**Note:** Avoid using Trace Flag 1204 on workload-intensive systems causing deadlocks. For more information about other means of detecting deadlocks, see the [Transaction Locking and Row Versioning Guide](../../relational-databases/sql-server-transaction-locking-and-row-versioning-guide.md#deadlock_detection).<br /><br />**Scope:** Global only. |
| <a id="tf1211"></a>**1211** | Disables lock escalation based on memory pressure, or based on number of locks. The [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] won't escalate row or page locks to table locks.<br /><br />Using this trace flag can generate excessive number of locks and if the lock memory grows large enough, attempts to allocate additional locks for any query may fail. This can slow the performance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)], or cause 1204 errors (unable to allocate lock resource) because of insufficient memory.<br /><br />If both trace flags 1211 and 1224 are set, 1211 takes precedence over 1224. However, because Trace Flag 1211 prevents escalation in every case, even under memory pressure, we recommend that you use 1224 instead. This helps avoid "out-of-locks" errors when many locks are being used.<br /><br />For more information on how to resolve blocking problems that are caused by lock escalation in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], see [KB323630](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/323630).<br /><br />**Scope:** Global or session. |
| <a id="tf1222"></a>**1222** | Returns the resources and types of locks that are participating in a deadlock and also the current command affected, in an XML format that doesn't comply with any XSD schema. For more information about deadlocks, see the [Transaction Locking and Row Versioning Guide](../../relational-databases/sql-server-transaction-locking-and-row-versioning-guide.md#deadlocks).<br /><br />**Note:** Avoid using Trace Flag 1222 on workload-intensive systems causing deadlocks. For more information about other means of detecting deadlocks, see the [Transaction Locking and Row Versioning Guide](../../relational-databases/sql-server-transaction-locking-and-row-versioning-guide.md#deadlock_detection).<br /><br />**Scope:** Global only. |
| <a id="tf1224"></a>**1224** | Disables lock escalation based on the number of locks. However, memory pressure can still activate lock escalation. The [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] escalates row or page locks to table (or partition) locks if the amount of memory used by lock objects exceeds one of the following conditions:<br /><ul><li>Forty percent of the memory that is used by [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)]. This is applicable only when the **locks** parameter of sp_configure is set to 0. <li>Forty percent of the lock memory that is configured by using the **locks** parameter of sp_configure. For more information, see [Server Configuration Options (SQL Server)](../../database-engine/configure-windows/server-configuration-options-sql-server.md).</li></ul><br />If both trace flags 1211 and 1224 are set, 1211 takes precedence over 1224. However, because Trace Flag 1211 prevents escalation in every case, even under memory pressure, we recommend that you use 1224. This helps avoid "out-of-locks" errors when many locks are being used.<br /><br />**Note:** Lock escalation to the table-level or HoBT-level granularity can also be controlled by using the LOCK_ESCALATION option of the [ALTER TABLE](../../t-sql/statements/alter-table-transact-sql.md) statement.<br /><br />For more information on how to resolve blocking problems that are caused by lock escalation in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], see [KB323630](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/323630).<br /><br />**Scope:** Global or session. |

When you do an UPDATE against a clustered index column, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] updates not only the clustered index itself, but also all the non-clustered indexes because the non-clustered indexes contain the cluster key. A common way that the update occurs is to update the clustered index, and then all non-clustered indexes at the same time. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] would update one row, then move to next row until all is complete. This is called narrow plan update or also called Per-Row Update.

| <a id="tf2544"></a>**2544** | Causes a memory dump of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to become a full dump (default is mini dump). Full dumps are a complete copy of the active target process memory. That would include all thread state, all process allocated memory, and all loaded modules. Full dumps will therefore have a size roughly the amount of memory used by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] process, which in turn may be almost as large as total system RAM. On large servers dedicated to a single [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance, it might mean a file that is several hundreds of gigabytes or more.<br /><br />**Warning:** Generating a full memory dump can suspend the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] process for an extended period of time (several seconds to several minutes) and may generate a very large dump file. Use this with caution and only rarely if the situation requires it.<br /><br />For more detailed information, see [Use the Sqldumper.exe utility to generate a dump file in SQL Server](/troubleshoot/sql/tools/use-sqldumper-generate-dump-file).<br /><br />**Scope:** Global only. |
| <a id="tf2549"></a>**2549** | Forces the `DBCC CHECKDB` command to assume each database file is on a unique disk drive but treating different physical files as one logical file. `DBCC CHECKDB` command builds an internal list of pages to read per unique disk drive across all database files. This logic determines unique disk drives based on the drive letter of the physical file name of each file.<br /><br />**Note:** Don't use this trace flag unless you know that each file is based on a unique physical disk.<br /><br />**Note:** Although this trace flag improves the performance of the `DBCC CHECKDB` commands that target usage of the PHYSICAL_ONLY option, some users may not see any improvement in performance.

| <a id="tf2551"></a>**2551** | Causes a memory dump of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to become a filtered dump (default is mini dump). This captures a percentage of full memory, where large areas of memory structures pertaining to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] are purposefully filtered out and not serialized to disk as they bring no troubleshooting added value (typically, data/index pages, some internal caches like [!INCLUDE [inmemory-md](../../includes/inmemory-md.md)] data pages and Log Pool memory). This results in a file, which is smaller than a full memory dump while retaining most of its usefulness as preferred option in most situations where mini dumps aren't sufficient.

By default, the `DBCC CHECKDB` command tries to minimize `tempdb` resources by limiting the number of indexes or "facts" that it generates by using a "batches" concept. But this trace flag forces all processing into one batch.<br /><br />One effect of using this trace flag is that the space requirements for `tempdb` may increase. `tempdb` may grow to as much as 5% or more of the user database that is being processed by the `DBCC CHECKDB` command.<br /><br />**Note:** Although this trace flag improves the performance of the `DBCC CHECKDB` commands that target usage of the PHYSICAL_ONLY option, some users may not see any improvement in performance.
