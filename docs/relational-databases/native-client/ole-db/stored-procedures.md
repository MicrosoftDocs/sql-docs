# Stored Procedures
[!INCLUDE[SNAC_Deprecated](../../../includes/snac-deprecated.md)]

  A stored procedure ([Stored Procedures &#40;Database Engine&#41;](../../../relational-databases/stored-procedures/stored-procedures-database-engine.md)) is an executable object stored in a database. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] supports:  
  
-   Stored procedures  
  
     One or more SQL statements that have been precompiled into a single executable procedure.  
  
-   Extended stored procedures  
  
     C or C++ dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) written to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Open Data Services API for extended stored procedures. The Open Data Services API extends the capabilities of stored procedures to include C or C++ code.
