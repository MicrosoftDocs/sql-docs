# Transactions in ODBC
Transactions in ODBC are completed at the connection level; that is, when an application completes a transaction, it commits or rolls back all work done through all statement handles on that connection.  
  
 This section contains the following topics.  
  
-   [Transaction Support](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/transaction-support.md)  
  
-   [Commit Mode](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/commit-mode.md)  
  
-   [Committing and Rolling Back Transactions](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/committing-and-rolling-back-transactions.md)  
  
-   [Effect of Transactions on Cursors and Prepared Statements](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/effect-of-transactions-on-cursors-and-prepared-statements.md)
