# Providing Feedback for SQL Server 2014
  [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] appreciates you taking the time to help us improver our [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] products and documentation. You can provide suggestions and bug reports about the product features and user interface, submit documentation feedback, and opt to send error reports and usage data automatically to [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] for analysis. Each of these three feedback options is described here.  
  
## Submitting Feedback About the Product  
 Use the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] feedback page on [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] Connect to send suggestions and bug reports about [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] features. This includes features such as the tools and utilities, languages, and programming interfaces.  
  
 You can find the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] Connect [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] feedback page in many ways.  
  
-   Go to the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] Connect [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] feedback [Web page](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=34178).  
  
-   On the Help toolbar of the [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], click the **Send Feedback** button, or select the **Community/Send Feedback** command.  
  
-   On the Help toolbar of the [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], Click the **Send Feedback** button.  
  
-   At the top of any topic in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Books Online, click the **Send Feedback** button.  
  
 The Help toolbar does not appear in the [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] until you either:  
  
-   Access Help from the utility.  
  
-   Select the **Help** check box on the **Toolbars** tab of the **Tools/Customize...** command.  
  
## Automatic Error and Usage Reporting  
 You can enable features to automatically report errors and to send data about how you use [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] software and services. [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] uses this information to improve [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. All the data is confidential.  
  
### Managing Automatic Usage Reporting  
 Automatic usage reporting enables you to decide whether to collect and send data to [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)]. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] uses two pipelines to report usage data. Both pipelines report similar data but the data for different programs and are turned on or off separately. Turning a pipeline on or off using any one of the programs also stops or starts data collection from the other programs that share the same pipeline.  
  
-   One pipeline is used to report usage data for all [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], except for Books Online and some of the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] Visual Studio-based user interface elements in the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] tools. After setup, you can also turn off (or turn on) this pipeline. To do this, in the [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], open a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]-based project and then, from the **Help** menu, select **Customer Feedback Options**. This command will not appear until you have opened a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]-based project.  
  
-   The other pipeline is used for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Books Online, the Visual Studio-based user interface elements of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] tools, and Visual Studio. After setup, you can also turn off (or turn on) this pipeline. To do this, in the [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], open a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]-based project and then, from the **Help** menu, select **Customer Feedback Options**. This command will not appear until you have opened a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]-based project.  
  
## Helping Build a Better Books Online  
 By opting to enable usage reporting for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Books Online, you help the team develop better documentation. The aggregate data we receive helps us learn what customers need. We learn how they move between topics, how often they view particular topics, and which topics they consider to be the most useful and the least useful.  
  
 Your feedback enables us to understand how you use the documentation. This helps us allocate our writing resources to the most important topics and design future documentation systems for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. This usage information from Books Online also helps us identify the features for which customers frequently seek help. This indicates areas that might need usability improvements.
