# Discontinued Master Data Services Features
  This topic describes [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] features that are no longer available in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
## [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] Discontinued Features  
 The [!INCLUDE[ssKilimanjaro](../includes/sskilimanjaro-md.md)] staging process is removed in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)]. You should use the entity based staging process to import and modify data. For more information, see [Overview: Importing Data from Tables &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../master-data-services/overview-importing-data-from-tables-master-data-services.md).  
  
 The Metadata model is no longer available. You can also no longer view metadata in the Explorer functional area.
