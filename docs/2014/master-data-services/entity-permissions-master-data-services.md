# Entity Permissions (Master Data Services)
  Entity permissions apply to:  
  
-   All of the entity's attributes, including **Name** and **Code**, for both leaf and consolidated members.  
  
-   All of the entity's collections.  
  
-   Explicit hierarchy memberships and relationships.  
  
 When you have permission to an entity, you can add and remove members from the entity, its explicit hierarchies, and its collections.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  These permissions apply to the **Explorer** functional area of the user interface only.  
  
|Permission|Description|  
|----------------|-----------------|
