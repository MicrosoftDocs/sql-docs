# sp_replmonitorhelppublisher (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Returns current status information for one or more Publishers associated with a Distributor. This stored procedure, which is used to monitor replication, is executed at the Distributor on the distribution database.

## Syntax  
  
```  
  
sp_replmonitorhelppublisher [ [ @publisher = ] 'publisher' ]  
    [ , [ @refreshpolicy = ] refreshpolicy ]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 [ **@publisher** = ] **'***publisher***'**  
 Is the name of the Publisher the status of which is being monitored. *publisher* is **sysname**, with a default value of NULL. If NULL, information will be returned for all Publishers that use the Distributor.  
  
 [ **@refreshpolicy=** ] *refreshpolicy*  
 Internal use only.  
  
## Result Sets  
  
|Column name|Data type|Description|  
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|  
|**publisher**|**sysname**|Is the name of a Publisher.|  
|**distribution_db**|**sysname**|Is the name of the distribution database used by a given Publisher.|  
|**status**|**int**|Maximum status of all replication agents associated with publications at this Publisher, which can be one of these values.<br /><br /> **1** = Started<br /><br /> **2** = Succeeded<br /><br /> **3** = In progress<br /><br /> **4** = Idle<br /><br /> **5** = Retrying<br /><br /> **6** = Failed|  
|**warning**|**int**|Maximum threshold warning generated by a subscription belonging to a publication at this Publisher, which can be the logical OR result of one or more of these values.<br /><br /> **1** = expiration - a subscription to a transactional publication has not been synchronized within the retention period threshold.<br /><br /> **2** = latency - the time taken to replicate data from a transactional Publisher to the Subscriber exceeds the threshold, in seconds.<br /><br /> **4** = mergeexpiration - a subscription to a merge publication has not been synchronized within the retention period threshold.<br /><br /> **8** = mergefastrunduration - the time taken to complete synchronization of a merge subscription exceeds the threshold, in seconds, over a fast network connection.<br /><br /> **16** = mergeslowrunduration - the time taken to complete synchronization of a merge subscription exceeds the threshold, in seconds, over a slow or dial-up network connection.<br /><br /> **32** = mergefastrunspeed - the delivery rate for rows during synchronization of a merge subscription has failed to maintain the threshold rate, in rows per second, over a fast network connection.<br /><br /> **64** = mergeslowrunspeed - the delivery rate for rows during synchronization of a merge subscription has failed to maintain the threshold rate, in rows per second, over a slow or dial-up network connection.|  
|**publicationcount**|**int**|Is the number of publications belonging to the Publisher.|  
  
## Return Code Values  
 **0** (success) or **1** (failure)  
  
## Remarks  
 **sp_replmonitorhelppublisher** is used with all types of replication.  
  
## Permissions  
 Only members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role at the Distributor or members of the **db_owner** or **replmonitor** fixed database roles in the distribution database can execute **sp_replmonitorhelppublisher**.
