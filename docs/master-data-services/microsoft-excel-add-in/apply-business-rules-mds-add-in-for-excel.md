# Apply Business Rules (MDS Add-in for Excel)

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly.md)]

  In the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssMDSXLS](../../includes/ssmdsxls-md.md)] apply business rules when you want to validate data and confirm that it is valid. You can correct validations and re-publish the data.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Data validation occurs automatically when you publish data. For more information, see [Validation &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../../master-data-services/validation-master-data-services.md).  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform this procedure:  
  
-   You must have access to the **Explorer** functional area.  
  
-   You must have an active worksheet that contains MDS-managed data.  
  
### To apply business rules  
  
1.  In the **Publish and Validate** group, click **Apply Rules**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The number of members (rows) that are validated at one time depends on a setting in [!INCLUDE[ssMDScfgmgr](../../includes/ssmdscfgmgr-md.md)]. For more information, see [Business Rule Settings](../../master-data-services/system-settings-master-data-services.md#BusinessRules).  
  
2.  The data is validated against business rules and two status columns are displayed. If these columns are not displayed automatically, in the **Publish and Validate** group, click **Show Status** to view them.
