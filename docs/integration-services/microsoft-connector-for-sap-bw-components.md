# Microsoft Connector for SAP BW Components

[!INCLUDE[sqlserver-ssis](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver-ssis.md)]


  This section contains topics that describe the three components of the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] Connector 1.1 for SAP BW:  
  
-   SAP BW connection manager  
  
-   SAP BW source  
  
-   SAP BW destination

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft does not anticipate providing an updated version of the Connector for SAP BW. Microsoft does not own the source code for the SAP BW components, which were developed by a third party, and as a result cannot update them. Consider purchasing the latest SAP connectivity components from a Microsoft ISV partner such as [Theobald Software](https://help.theobald-software.com/en/xtract-is/). Microsoft's ISV partners have adapted their SAP connectivity components for SSIS for installation in Azure.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  The documentation for the Microsoft Connector 1.1 for SAP BW assumes familiarity with the SAP Netweaver BW environment. For more information about SAP Netweaver BW, or for information about how to configure SAP Netweaver BW objects and processes, see your SAP documentation.  
  
## In This Section  
 [SAP BW Connection Manager](../integration-services/connection-manager/sap-bw-connection-manager.md)

 [SAP BW Source](../integration-services/data-flow/sap-bw-source.md)  
 Describes the SAP BW source that lets you extract data from an SAP Netweaver BW system.  
  
 [SAP BW Destination](../integration-services/data-flow/sap-bw-destination.md)
