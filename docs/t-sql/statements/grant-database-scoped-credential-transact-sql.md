# GRANT Database Scoped Credential permissions (Transact-SQL) 
[!INCLUDE[sqlserver2017-asdb-asdbmi-asa](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2017-asdb-asdbmi-asa.md)]

Grants permissions on a database scoped credential.

## Syntax  
  
```syntaxsql
GRANT permission  [ ,...n ]    
    ON DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL :: credential_name   
    TO principal [ ,...n ] [ WITH GRANT OPTION ]   
    [ AS granting_principal ]   
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Arguments

#### *permission*  
 Specifies a permission that can be granted on a database scoped credential. Listed below.  
  
#### ON DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL **::**_credential_name_  
 Specifies the database scoped credential on which the permission is being granted. The scope qualifier "::" is required.  
  
#### *database_principal*  
 Specifies the principal to which the permission is being granted. One of the following:  
  
-   database user  
-   database role  
-   application role  
-   database user mapped to a Windows login  
-   database user mapped to a Windows group  
-   database user mapped to a certificate  
-   database user mapped to an asymmetric key  
-   database user not mapped to a server principal.  
  
#### GRANT OPTION  
 Indicates that the principal will also be given the ability to grant the specified permission to other principals.  
  
#### AS *granting_principal*  
 Specifies a principal from which the principal executing this query derives its right to grant the permission. One of the following:  
  
-   database user  
-   database role  
-   application role  
-   database user mapped to a Windows login  
-   database user mapped to a Windows group  
-   database user mapped to a certificate  
-   database user mapped to an asymmetric key  
-   database user not mapped to a server principal.  
  
## Remarks  
 A database scoped credential is a database-level securable contained by the database that is its parent in the permissions hierarchy. The most specific and limited permissions that can be granted on a database scoped credential are listed below, together with the more general permissions that include them by implication.  
  
|Database scoped credential permission|Implied by database scoped credential permission|Implied by database permission|  
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------|  
|CONTROL|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|TAKE OWNERSHIP|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|ALTER|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|REFERENCES|CONTROL|REFERENCES|  
|VIEW DEFINITION|CONTROL|VIEW DEFINITION|  

> [!NOTE]
> In Azure Synapse Analytics, GRANT on database scoped credential is supported for serverless SQL pools only.
  
## Permissions  
 The grantor (or the principal specified with the AS option) must have either the permission itself with GRANT OPTION, or a higher permission that implies the permission being granted.  
  
 If using the AS option, these additional requirements apply.  
  
|AS *granting_principal*|Additional permission required|  
|------------------------------|------------------------------------|  
|Database user|IMPERSONATE permission on the user, membership in the **db_securityadmin** fixed database role, membership in the **db_owner** fixed database role, or membership in the **sysadmin** fixed server role.|  
|Database user mapped to a Windows login|IMPERSONATE permission on the user, membership in the **db_securityadmin** fixed database role, membership in the **db_owner** fixed database role, or membership in the **sysadmin** fixed server role.|  
|Database user mapped to a Windows group|Membership in the Windows group, membership in the **db_securityadmin** fixed database role, membership in the **db_owner** fixed database role, or membership in the **sysadmin** fixed server role.|  
|Database user mapped to a certificate|Membership in the **db_securityadmin** fixed database role, membership in the **db_owner** fixed database role, or membership in the **sysadmin** fixed server role.|  
|Database user mapped to an asymmetric key|Membership in the **db_securityadmin** fixed database role, membership in the **db_owner** fixed database role, or membership in the **sysadmin** fixed server role.|  
|Database user not mapped to any server principal|IMPERSONATE permission on the user, membership in the **db_securityadmin** fixed database role, membership in the **db_owner** fixed database role, or membership in the **sysadmin** fixed server role.|  
|Database role|ALTER permission on the role, membership in the **db_securityadmin** fixed database role, membership in the **db_owner** fixed database role, or membership in the **sysadmin** fixed server role.|  
|Application role|ALTER permission on the role, membership in the **db_securityadmin** fixed database role, membership in the **db_owner** fixed database role, or membership in the **sysadmin** fixed server role.|  
  
 Object owners can grant permissions on the objects they own. Principals with CONTROL permission on a securable can grant permission on that securable.  
  
 Grantees of CONTROL SERVER permission, such as members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role, can grant any permission on any securable in the server. Grantees of CONTROL permission on a database, such as members of the **db_owner** fixed database role, can grant any permission on any securable in the database. Grantees of CONTROL permission on a schema can grant any permission on any object within the schema.
