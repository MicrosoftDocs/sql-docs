# Coding and Debugging the Script Task
  After configuring the Script task in the **Script Task Editor**, you write your custom code in the Script task development environment.  
  
## Script Task Development Environment  
 The Script task uses [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] Tools for Applications (VSTA) as the development environment for the script itself.  
  
 Script code is written in [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Visual Basic or [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Visual C#. You specify the script language by setting the **ScriptLanguage** property in the **Script Task Editor**. If you prefer to use another programming language, you can develop a custom assembly in your language of choice and call its functionality from the code in the Script task.  
  
 The script that you create in the Script task is stored in the package definition. There is no separate script file. Therefore, the use of the Script task does not affect package deployment.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  When you design the package and debug the script, the script code is temporarily written to a project file. Because storing sensitive information in a file is a potential security risk, we recommend that you do not include sensitive information such as passwords in the script code.  
  
 By default, **Option Strict** is disabled in the IDE.  
  
## Script Task Project Structure  
 When you create or modify the script that is contained in a Script task, VSTA opens an empty new project or reopens the existing project. The creation of this VSTA project does not affect the deployment of the package, because the project is saved inside the package file; the Script task does not create additional files.  
  
### Project Items and Classes in the Script Task Project  
 By default, the Script task project displayed in the VSTA Project Explorer window contains a single item, **ScriptMain**. The **ScriptMain** item, in turn, contains a single class, also named **ScriptMain**. The code elements in the class vary depending on the programming language that you selected for the Script task:  
  
-   When the Script task is configured for the [!INCLUDE[vb_orcas_long](../../../includes/vb-orcas-long-md.md)] programming language, the **ScriptMain** class has a public subroutine, **Main**. The **ScriptMain.Main** subroutine is the method that the runtime calls when you run your Script task.  
  
     By default, the only code in the **Main** subroutine of a new script is the line `Dts.TaskResult = ScriptResults.Success`. This line informs the runtime that the task was successful in its operation. The **Dts.TaskResult** property is discussed in [Returning Results from the Script Task](../../../integration-services/extending-packages-scripting/task/returning-results-from-the-script-task.md).  
  
-   When the Script task is configured for the Visual C# programming language, the **ScriptMain** class has a public method, **Main**. The method is called when the Script task runs.  
  
     By default, the **Main** method includes the line `Dts.TaskResult = (int)ScriptResults.Success`. This line informs the runtime that the task was successful in its operation.  
  
 The **ScriptMain** item can contain classes other than the **ScriptMain** class. Classes are available only to the Script task in which they reside.  
  
 By default, the **ScriptMain** project item contains the following autogenerated code. The code template also provides an overview of the Script task, and additional information on how to retrieve and manipulate SSIS objects, such as variables, events, and connections.  
  
```vb  
' Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services Script Task  
' Write scripts using Microsoft Visual Basic 2008.  
' The ScriptMain is the entry point class of the script.  
  
Imports System

End Sub  
  
Private Sub ScriptMain_Shutdown(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Me.Shutdown  
Try  
' Unlock variables from the read-only and read-write variable collection properties  
If (Dts.Variables.Count <> 0) Then  
Dts.Variables.Unlock()  
End If  
Catch ex As Exception  
        End Try  
End Sub  
  
Enum ScriptResults  
Success = DTSExecResult.Success  
Failure = DTSExecResult.Failure  
End Enum  
  
' The execution engine calls this method when the task executes.  
' To access the object model, use the Dts property. Connections, variables, events,  
' and logging features are available as members of the Dts property as shown in the following examples.  
'  
' To reference a variable, call Dts.Variables("MyCaseSensitiveVariableName").Value  
' To post a log entry, call Dts.Log("This is my log text", 999, Nothing)  
' To fire an event, call Dts.Events.FireInformation(99, "test", "hit the help message", "", 0, True)  
'  
' To use the connections collection use something like the following:  
' ConnectionManager cm = Dts.Connections.Add("OLEDB")  
' cm.ConnectionString = "Data Source=localhost;Initial Catalog=AdventureWorks;Provider=SQLNCLI10;Integrated Security=SSPI;Auto Translate=False;"  
'  
' Before returning from this method, set the value of Dts.TaskResult to indicate success or failure.  
'   
' To open Help, press F1.  
  
Public Sub Main()  
'  
' Add your code here  
'  
Dts.TaskResult = ScriptResults.Success  
End Sub  
  
End Class

### Additional Project Items in the Script Task Project  
 The Script task project can include items other than the default **ScriptMain** item. You can add classes, modules, and code files to the project. You can also use folders to organize groups of items. All the items that you add are persisted inside the package.  
  
### References in the Script Task Project  
 You can add references to managed assemblies by right-clicking the Script task project in **Project Explorer**, and then clicking **Add Reference**. For more information, see [Referencing Other Assemblies in Scripting Solutions](../../../integration-services/extending-packages-scripting/referencing-other-assemblies-in-scripting-solutions.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  You can view project references in the VSTA IDE in **Class View** or in **Project Explorer**. You open either of these windows from the **View** menu. You can add a new reference from the **Project** menu, from **Project Explorer**, or from **Class View**.  
  
## Interacting with the Package in the Script Task  
 The Script task uses the global **Dts** object, which is an instance of the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Tasks.ScriptTask.ScriptObjectModel> class, and its members to interact with the containing package and with the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] runtime.  
  
 The following table lists the principal public members of the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Tasks.ScriptTask.ScriptObjectModel> class, which is exposed to Script task code through the global **Dts** object. The topics in this section discuss the use of these members in more detail.  
  
|Member|Purpose|  
|------------|-------------|  
|<xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Tasks.ScriptTask.ScriptObjectModel.Connections%2A>|Provides access to connection managers defined in the package.|  
|<xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Tasks.ScriptTask.ScriptObjectModel.Events%2A>|Provides an events interface to let the Script task raise errors, warnings, and informational messages.|  
|<xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Tasks.ScriptTask.ScriptObjectModel.ExecutionValue%2A>|Provides a simple way to return a single object to the runtime (in addition to the **TaskResult**) that can also be used for workflow branching.|  
|<xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Tasks.ScriptTask.ScriptObjectModel.Log%2A>|Logs information such as task progress and results to enabled log providers.|  
|<xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Tasks.ScriptTask.ScriptObjectModel.TaskResult%2A>|Reports the success or failure of the task.|  
|<xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Tasks.ScriptTask.ScriptObjectModel.Transaction%2A>|Provides the transaction, if any, within which the task's container is running.|  
|<xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Tasks.ScriptTask.ScriptObjectModel.Variables%2A>|Provides access to the variables listed in the **ReadOnlyVariables** and **ReadWriteVariables** task properties for use within the script.|  
  
 The <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Tasks.ScriptTask.ScriptObjectModel> class also contains some public members that you will probably not use.  
  
|Member|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|<xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Tasks.ScriptTask.ScriptObjectModel.VariableDispenser%2A>|The <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Tasks.ScriptTask.ScriptObjectModel.Variables%2A> property provides more convenient access to variables. Although you can use the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Tasks.ScriptTask.ScriptObjectModel.VariableDispenser%2A>, you must explicitly call methods to lock and unlock variables for reading and writing. The Script task handles locking semantics for you when you use the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Tasks.ScriptTask.ScriptObjectModel.Variables%2A> property.|  
  
## Debugging the Script Task  
 To debug the code in your Script task, set at least one breakpoint in the code, and then close the VSTA IDE to run the package in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)]. When package execution enters the Script task, the VSTA IDE reopens and displays your code in read-only mode. After execution reaches your breakpoint, you can examine variable values and step through the remaining code.  
  
> [!WARNING]  
>  You cannot debug the Script task when you run the package in 64-bit mode.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  You must execute the package to debug into your Script task. If you execute only the individual task, breakpoints in the Script task code are ignored.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  You cannot debug a Script task when you run the Script task as part of a child package that is run from an Execute Package task. Breakpoints that you set in the Script task in the child package are disregarded in these circumstances. You can debug the child package normally by running it separately.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  When you debug a package that contains multiple Script tasks, the debugger debugs one Script task. The system can debug another Script task if the debugger completes, as in the case of a Foreach Loop or For Loop container.
