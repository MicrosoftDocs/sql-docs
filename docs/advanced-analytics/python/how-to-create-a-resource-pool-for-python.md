# How To Create a Resource Pool for Python

This section is under development.

> [!NOTE]
> Python support is a new feature in SQL Server 2017 and is in prerelease. Look for more information soon.

In general, you can monitor any external script, including one that runs Python, using the same framework that was provided for resource governance of R scripts in SQL Server 2016. For more information, see [Resource Governance for R](../r/resource-governance-for-r-services.md).
