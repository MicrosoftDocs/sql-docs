# Persisting Records in XML Format
Like ADTG format, **Recordset** persistence in XML format is implemented with the Microsoft OLE DB Persistence Provider. This provider generates a forward-only, read-only rowset from a saved XML file or stream that contains the schema information generated by ADO. Similarly, it can take an ADO **Recordset**, generate XML, and save it to a file or any object that implements the COM **IStream** interface. (In fact, a file is just another example of an object that supports **IStream**.) For versions 2.5 and later, ADO relies on the Microsoft XML Parser (MSXML) to load the XML into the **Recordset**; therefore msxml.dll is required.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Some limitations apply when saving hierarchical **Recordsets** (data shapes) to XML format. You cannot save to XML if the hierarchical **Recordset** contains pending updates, and you cannot save a parameterized hierarchical **Recordset**. For more information, see [Persisting Filtered and Hierarchical Recordsets](../../../ado/guide/data/persisting-filtered-and-hierarchical-recordsets.md).  
  
 The easiest way to persist data into XML and load it back again through ADO is with the **Save** and **Open** methods, respectively. The following ADO code example demonstrates saving the data in the **Titles** table to a file that is named titles.sav.  
  
```  
Dim rs as new Recordset  
Dim rs2 as new Recordset  
Dim c as new Connection  
Dim s as new Stream  
  
' Query the Titles table.  
c.Open "provider=sqloledb;data source=MySQLServer;initial catalog=pubs;Integrated Security='SSPI'"  
rs.cursorlocation = adUseClient  
rs.Open "select * from titles", c, adOpenStatic  
  
' Save to the file in the XML format. Note that if you don't specify   
' adPersistXML, a binary format (ADTG) will be used by default.  
rs.Save "titles.sav", adPersistXML  
  
' Save the recordset into the ADO Stream object.  
rs.save s, adPersistXML  
rs.Close  
c.Close  
  
set rs = nothing  
  
' Reopen the file.  
rs.Open "titles.sav",,,,adCmdFile  
' Open the Stream back into a Recordset.  
rs2.open s  
```  
  
 ADO always persists the entire **Recordset** object. If you want to persist a subset of rows of the **Recordset** object, use the **Filter** method to narrow down the rows or change your selection clause. However, you must open a **Recordset** object with a client-side cursor (**CursorLocation** = **adUseClient**) to use the **Filter** method for saving a subset of rows. For example, to retrieve titles that start with the letter "b," you can apply a filter to an open **Recordset** object:  
  
```  
rs.Filter "title_id like 'B*'"  
rs.Save "btitles.sav", adPersistXML  
```  
  
 ADO always uses the Client Cursor Engine rowset to produce a scrollable, bookmarkable **Recordset** object on top of the forward-only data generated by the Persistence Provider.
