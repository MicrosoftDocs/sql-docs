# Create a Basic Table Report (SSRS Tutorial)

In this tutorial, you use *Report Designer* in Visual Studio / SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) to create a basic [!INCLUDE[ssrsnoversion-md](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] paginated report with a table, based on the **AdventureWorks2016** database. You can also create [!INCLUDE[ssrsnoversion-md](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] paginated reports with Report Builder.

As you go through this tutorial, you will create a report project, set up connection information, define a query, add a table data region, group and total some fields, preview and optionally publish the report.

## Requirements

Your system must have the following installed to use this tutorial:

- [!INCLUDE[msconame-md](../includes/msconame-md.md)] SQL Server database engine.  
- SQL Server 2016 Reporting Services or later (SSRS).
- The **AdventureWorks2016** database.  For more information, see [Adventure Works Sample Databases](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases).
- [SQL Server Data Tools](../ssdt/download-sql-server-data-tools-ssdt.md) for Visual Studio along with the Visual Studio *Report Services* extension installed to enable access to the *Report Designer*.
  
You must also have read-only permissions to retrieve data from the **AdventureWorks2016** database.

**Estimated time to complete the tutorial:** 30 minutes.
