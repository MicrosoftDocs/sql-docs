# Convert Types without Conversion Checking (SQL Server Import and Export Wizard)
  Use the **Convert Types without Conversion Checking** page to review the mappings that the wizard performs when the wizard cannot locate one or more of the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] data type conversion and mapping files. This page includes information that helps you identify the missing file or files.  
  
 To learn more about this wizard, see [SQL Server Import and Export Wizard](import-and-export-data-with-the-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md). To learn about the options for starting the wizard, and about the permissions required to run the wizard successfully, see [Run the SQL Server Import and Export Wizard](start-the-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md).  
  
 The purpose of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Import and Export Wizard is to copy data from a source to a destination. The wizard can also create a destination database and destination tables for you. However, if you have to copy multiple databases or tables, or other kinds of database objects, you should use the Copy Database Wizard instead. For more information, see [Use the Copy Database Wizard](../../relational-databases/databases/use-the-copy-database-wizard.md).
