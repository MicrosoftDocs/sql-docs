# MergePartitions command (TMSL)

[!INCLUDE[ssas-appliesto-sql2016-later-aas](../../includes/ssas-appliesto-sql2016-later-aas.md)]

  Merges the data of one or more source partitions into a target partition, and then deletes the source partition. The SQL Query of the target partition will not be updated as part of the merge. To ensure that subsequent processing of the partition retrieves all of the data, you should revise the query so that it selects all of the data in the merged partition.  
  
## Request  
 You must specify the database, table, and source and target partitions. You can only merge partitions from the same table.  
  
```  
{   
  "mergePartitions": {   
    "object": {   
      "database": "salesdatabase",   
      "table": "sales",   
      "partition": "may2015"   
    },   
    "sources": [   
      {   
        "database": "salesdatabase",   
        "table": "Sales",   
        "partition": "partition1"   
      },   
      {   
        "database": "salesdatabase",   
        "table": "Sales",   
        "partition": "partition2"   
      }   
    ]   
  }   
}  
  
```  
  
## Response  
 Returns an empty result when the command succeeds. Otherwise, an XMLA exception is returned.  
  
## Usage (endpoints)  
 This command element is used in  a statement of the [Execute Method &#40;XMLA&#41;](../../analysis-services/xmla/xml-elements-methods-execute.md) call over an XMLA endpoint, exposed in the following ways:  
  
-   As an XMLA window in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)  
  
-   As an input file to the **invoke-ascmd** PowerShell cmdlet  
  
-   As an input to an SSIS task or SQL Server Agent job  
  
 You can generate a ready-made script  for this command from SSMS.  For example, you can click the **Script** in Partition Management dialog box.  
  
 The [\[MS-SSAS-T\]: QL Server Analysis Services Tabular (SQL Server Technical Protocol)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=784855) document includes section 3.1.5.2.2 that describes the structure of JSON tabular metadata commands and objects. Currently, that document covers commands and capabilities not yet implemented in TMSL script. Refer to the topic [Tabular Model Scripting Language &#40;TMSL&#41; Reference](../../analysis-services/tabular-model-scripting-language-tmsl-reference.md) for clarification on what is supported  
  
 For instructions on how to leverage TMSL script in practical solutions, see [Script Administrative Tasks in Analysis Services](../../analysis-services/instances/script-administrative-tasks-in-analysis-services.md).
