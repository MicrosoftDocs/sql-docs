# MSreplication_monitordata (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

  The **MSreplication_monitordata** table contains cached data used by Replication Monitor, with one row for each monitored subscription. This table is stored in the distribution database.  
  
|Column name|Data type|Description|  
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|  
|**lastrefresh**|**datetime**|Date and time that the monitor data was refreshed.|  
|**computetime**|**int**|Is the time (in seconds) taken to compute monitor data.|  
|**publication_id**|**int**|The publication ID.|  
|**publisher**|**sysname**|The name of the Publisher.|  
|**publisher_srvid**|**int**|The server ID of the Publisher.|  
|**publisher_db**|**sysname**|The name of the publication database.|  
|**publication**|**sysname**|The name of the publication.|  
|**publication_type**|**int**|The type of publication, which can be one of these values:<br /><br /> **0** = Transactional publication<br /><br /> **1** = Snapshot publication<br /><br /> **2** = Merge publication|  
|**agent_type**|**int**|The type of replication agent, which can be one of these values.<br /><br /> **1** = Snapshot Agent<br /><br /> **2** = Log Reader Agent<br /><br /> **3** = Distribution Agent<br /><br /> **4** = Merge Agent<br /><br /> **9** = Queue Reader Agent|  
|**agent_id**|**int**|The ID of the replication agent.|  
|**agent_name**|**sysname**|The name of the replication agent job.|  
|**job_id**|**uniqueidentifier**|The GUID of the replication agent job.|  
|**status**|**int**|Status of the replication agent, which can be one of these values:<br /><br /> **1** = Started<br /><br /> **2** = Succeeded<br /><br /> **3** = In progress<br /><br /> **4** = Idle<br /><br /> **5** = Retrying<br /><br /> **6** = Failed|  
|**isagentrunningnow**|**bit**|A flag that indicates if the agent job is currently running, where a value of **1** means that the job is running.|  
|**warning**|**int**|Threshold warning generated by a subscription, which can be the logical OR result of one or more of these values.<br /><br /> **1** = expiration - a subscription to a transactional publication has exceeded the retention period by more than the allowable threshold, as a percentage of the retention period.<br /><br /> **2** = latency - the time taken to replicate data from a transactional Publisher to the Subscriber exceeds the threshold, in seconds.<br /><br /> **4** = mergeexpiration - a subscription to a merge publication has exceeded the retention period by more than the allowable threshold, as a percentage of the retention period. 8 = mergefastrunduration - the time taken to complete synchronization of a merge subscription exceeds the threshold, in seconds, over a fast network connection.<br /><br /> **16** = mergeslowrunduration - the time taken to complete synchronization of a merge subscription exceeds the threshold, in seconds, over a slow or dial-up network connection.<br /><br /> **32** = mergefastrunspeed - the delivery rate for rows during synchronization of a merge subscription has failed to maintain the threshold rate, in rows per second, over a fast network connection.<br /><br /> **64** = mergeslowrunspeed - the delivery rate for rows during synchronization of a merge subscription has failed to maintain the threshold rate, in rows per second, over a slow or dial-up network connection.|  
|**last_distsync**|**datetime**|The last date and time that the Distribution Agent ran.|  
|**agentstoptime**|**datetime**|The date and time that the agent stopped.|  
|**distdb**|**sysname**|Name of the distribution database for the subscription.|  
|**retention**|**int**|The retention period for the publication.|  
|**time_stamp**|**datetime**|Internal-use only.|  
|**worst_latency**|**int**|The highest latency, in seconds, for data changes propagated by the Log Reader or Distribution Agents for a transactional publication.|  
|**best_latency**|**int**|The lowest latency, in seconds, for data changes propagated by the Log Reader or Distribution Agents for a transactional publication.|  
|**avg_latency**|**int**|The average latency, in seconds, for data changes propagated by the Log Reader or Distribution Agents for a transactional publication.|  
|**cur_latency**|**int**|The latency, in seconds, for data changes propagated by the Log Reader or Distribution Agents during the current run.|  
|**worst_runspeedPerf**|**int**|The longest synchronization time for the merge publication|  
|**best_runspeedPerf**|**int**|The shortest synchronization time for the merge publication|  
|**average_runspeedPerf**|**int**|The average synchronization time for the merge publication|  
|**mergePerformance**|**int**|Performance of the last synchronization compared to all synchronizations for the subscription, which is based on the delivery rate of the last synchronization divided by the average of all previous delivery rates.|  
|**mergelatestsessionrunduration**|**int**|Duration of the most recent Merge Agent run.|  
|**mergelatestsessionrunspeed**|**float(53)**|Delivery rate of the most recent Merge Agent run.|  
|**mergelatestsessionconnectiontype**|**int**|Connection used for the most recent Merge Agent session, which can be one of the following values:<br /><br /> **1** = local area network (LAN)<br /><br /> **2** = dial-up network connection|  
|**retention_period_unit**|**tinyint**|Defines the unit used when defining retention, which can be one of these values:<br /><br /> **1** = week<br /><br /> **2** = month<br /><br /> **3** = year|
