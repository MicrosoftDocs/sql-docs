# Save Selected Tables on a Diagram (Visual Database Tools)
  You can save a specific table or a set of tables if you do not want to save all the changes you made in a database diagram.  
  
### To save selected tables  
  
1.  In your database diagram, select the tables you want to save.  
  
2.  From the **File** menu, choose **Save Selection**.  
  
3.  The **Save** dialog box displays the list of tables that will be updated in the database when you save your selection.  
  
     Choose **Save Text File** if you want to save the list of tables in a text file in the project directory before continuing.  
  
4.  In the **Save** dialog box, confirm the list of tables and choose **Yes** to save these tables.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The list of tables may contain tables in addition to those selected. For example, if you change the data type of a column that participates in a relationship with another table, both tables will be included in this list.
