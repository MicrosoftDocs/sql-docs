# Learn SQL Server Master Data Services

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server - Windows only ASDBMI](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-windows-only-asdbmi.md)]

  
  
## Training  

* To explore the new features and capabilities, try out a [Self-paced Lab](https://www.microsoft.com/handsonlabs/selfpacedlabs) (sign-in with your Microsoft account is required).  
* To develop a [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort_md](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] solution to store and manage master lists of geographic data, using the Add-in for Excel and the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm_md](../includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)], try out a [Self-paced Lab](https://www.microsoft.com/handsonlabs/selfpacedlabs). You'll create entities and hierarchies, and use [!INCLUDE[ssIS_md](../includes/ssis-md.md)] to populate a dimension table.  
  
## Videos  
* To learn about the new capabilities of [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort_md](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)], [**watch this video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKA72FpOVxI).  
  
## Samples  
* To learn more about how you can structure data in [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort_md](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] using models, entities, and hierarchies, try out the sample models that are included when you install [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort_md](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)]. For instructions on deploying the samples, see [Deploy Sample Models and Data](../master-data-services/master-data-services-installation-and-configuration.md#deploySample).   
  
    For information about updates to the sample models, see [SQL Server Samples: Model Deployment Packages](../master-data-services/sql-server-samples-model-deployment-packages-mds.md).  
  
* For a demonstration of how to customize the way that you and your users interact with [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort_md](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)], try out the MDS C# console application samples that are included with the SQL Server samples. You can download the SQL Server samples as a .zip file from this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples).  
  
    The following are the MDS application samples. The SQL Server samples download also includes    readmes that help you get started using the application samples.  
    * Master Data Services Business Rule API Sample  
    * Master Data Services Entity Based Staging API Sample
