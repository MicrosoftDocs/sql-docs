# Allow a Text Box to Grow or Shrink (Report Builder and SSRS)
  By default, text boxes are a fixed size. You can set options that let the text box expand or shrink based on its contents. These options correspond to the `CanGrow` or `CanShrink` properties in the Properties pane.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  [!INCLUDE[ssRBRDDup](../../includes/ssrbrddup-md.md)]  
  
### To Allow a Text Box to Grow or Shrink  
  
1.  Right-click the text box and click **Text Box Properties**.  
  
2.  Click the **General** tab.  
  
    -   To allow the text box to expand vertically based on its contents, select **Allow height to increase**.  
  
    -   To allow the text box to shrink based on its contents, select **Allow height to decrease**.
