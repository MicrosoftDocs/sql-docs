# New or Edit Server Registration (General Tab) (Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data)

## Options  
 **Server type**  
 When a server is registered from Registered Servers, the **Server type** box is read-only, and it matches the type of server displayed in the Registered Servers pane. To register a different type of server, click the server you want on the **Registered Servers** toolbar before starting to register a new server.
