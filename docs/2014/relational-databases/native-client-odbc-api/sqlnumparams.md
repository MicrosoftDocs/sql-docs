# SQLNumParams
  Improvements in the database engine beginning with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] allow SQLNumParams to obtain more accurate descriptions of the expected results. These more accurate results may differ from the values returned by SQLNumParams in previous versions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 For more information, see [Metadata Discovery](../native-client/features/metadata-discovery.md).
