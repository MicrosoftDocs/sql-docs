[!INCLUDE[ssas-appliesto-sqlas](../includes/ssas-appliesto-sqlas.md)]

  The Data Mining Extensions (DMX) reference documentation in [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] uses the following conventions to describe the DMX language.  
  
|Convention|Usage|  
|----------------|-----------|  
|**bold**|DMX keywords and text that must be typed exactly as shown.|  
|*italic*|User-supplied arguments of DMX syntax.|  
|&#124; (vertical bar)|Used to separate syntax items within brackets or braces. You can choose only one of the items.|  
|`[ ]` (brackets)|Contain optional syntax items. Do not type the brackets.|  
|{ } (braces)|Contain required syntax items. Do not type the braces.|  
|, ...|Indicates that the item before the comma can be repeated any number of times. The items are separated by commas.|  
|\<label> ::=|The name for a block of syntax. This convention is used to group and label sections of lengthy syntax or a unit of syntax that can be used in more than one location within a statement. Each location in which the block of syntax can be used is indicated with the label enclosed in chevrons, such as \<label>.|
