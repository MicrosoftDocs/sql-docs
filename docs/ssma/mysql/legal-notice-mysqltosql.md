# Legal Notice (MySQLToSql)
This documentation, including sample applications herein, is provided for information purposes only, and this documentation is provided without any warranties, either express or implied. Information in this documentation, including URL and other Internet Web site references, is subject to change without notice. The entire risk of the use or the results of the use of this documentation remains with the user.  
  
The primary purpose of a sample contained within this documentation is to illustrate a concept, or a reasonable use of a particular statement or clause. Most samples do not include all of the code that may normally be found in a full production system, as some of the usual data validation and error handling is removed to focus the sample on a particular concept or statement. Technical support is not available for these samples or for any included source code.  
  
Unless otherwise noted, the example companies, organizations, products, domain names, e-mail addresses, people, places, and events depicted herein are fictitious, and no association with any real company, organization, product, domain name, e-mail address, person, place, or event is intended or should be inferred. Complying with all applicable copyright laws is the responsibility of the user. Without limiting the rights under copyright, no part of this documentation may be reproduced, stored in or introduced into a retrieval system, or transmitted in any form or by any means (electronic, mechanical, photocopying, recording, or otherwise), or for any purpose, without the express written permission of Microsoft Corporation.

## Documentation Policy for SQL Server Support and Upgrade  
Content that appears in SQL Server documentation is published only after it has been tested sufficiently. Product documentation - SQL Server Books Online, readme files, known issues documents, and Knowledge Base articles - contains content regarding SQL Server features and functionality that is robust enough to be safe for general use by all customers. This policy applies to all SQL Server documentation, including readme files for releases and services packs; a readme file is considered an extension of Books Online.  
  
In some cases, a particular feature is not something that customers should use directly and, therefore, it is not documented. Unless a feature is also discussed in SQL Server documentation published by Microsoft, content from third-party books or Web sites is not supported by Microsoft customer support, and should not be used in production databases or applications.  
  
Customers must not use undocumented APIs, including but not limited to: stored procedures, extended stored procedures, functions, views, tables, columns, properties, or metadata. Microsoft customer support will not support databases or applications that leverage or use undocumented entry points.  
  
Server and database upgrades to future versions of SQL Server are not guaranteed for applications and databases that leverage and use undocumented entry points. Use of SQL Server features and functionality must be limited to those that are included in Microsoft SQL Server documentation. If a feature is not documented in Microsoft SQL Server documentation, it is not a supported part of SQL Server.
