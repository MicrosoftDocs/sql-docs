# PropertyList Element - Supported XMLA Properties
  [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] supports the properties listed in the following table. You use these listed properties in the [Properties](../../../analysis-services/xmla/xml-elements-properties/properties-element-xmla.md) element of the [Discover](../../../analysis-services/xmla/xml-elements-methods-discover.md) and [Execute](../../../analysis-services/xmla/xml-elements-methods-execute.md) methods.

|Dialect|You can use the **Dialect** property when you expect that most of queries will use one particular dialect over any other.<br /><br /> Query syntax can be similar for language dialects, such as DMX and SQL. Because the syntax can be similar, [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] may not be able to infer the dialect from the query syntax. If a query does not run in one dialect, the [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] instance may try to run the query again in a different dialect.<br /><br /> If the **Dialect** property is set, [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] returns query execution errors in the dialect that has precedence, even if the provider tries to run the query again in another dialect. For example, the **Dialect** property is set to MDGUID_DM. The provider first tries to run the query as a data mining query, but this query fails. The provider then resubmits the query as an SQL query. However, this SQL query also fails. Because the value of the **Dialect** property is MDGUID_DM, [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] returns a data mining error message, not an SQL error message.<br /><br /> If the **Dialect** property is not set, [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] returns query execution errors in the dialect last used. For example, the **Dialect** property is not set, and a data mining query fails. The provider then resubmits the query as SQL. The SQL query also fails. Because the **Dialect** property is not set, the provider returns an SQL error message instead of a data mining error message.<br /><br /> This property can be used with the **Discover** and **Execute** methods.<br /><br /> There is no default value for this property. Establishes the dialect used in the following situations:<br /><br /> -The dialect that the provider will use the first time that the provider tries to run a query.<br /><br /> -The dialect used for the execution errors returned as the result of query failures.|Optional, read/write **String** property|The following **Name**: **Value** pairs are dialects available to this property:<br /><br /> **DBGUID_SQL**: <br />                          *C8B522D7-5CF3-11CE-ADE5-00AA0044773D*. The SQL parser has precedence.<br /><br /> **MDGUID_DM**: <br />                          *62C58FED-CCA5-44F1-83B6-7B45682B3904*. The DMX parser has precedence.<br /><br /> **MDGUID_MDX**: <br />                          *A07CCCD0-8148-11D0-87BB-00C04FC33942*. The MDX parser has precedence.|

|EffectiveRoles|Reserved for future use.<br /><br /> There is no default value for this property.<br /><br /> This property can be used with the **Discover** and **Execute** methods.|Optional, write-only **String** property||  
|EffectiveUserName|Specifies the name of an account to use to override the user name when connecting to an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] instance. The value of the property is not normalized, in that the MDX [UserName](../../../mdx/username-mdx.md) function returns the literal value if this property is used. This property can only be used by server administrators.<br /><br /> This property supports the following SID types: User, Group, Alias, WellKnownGroup, Computer.<br /><br /> There is no default value for this property.<br /><br /> This property can be used with the **Discover** and **Execute** methods.|Optional, write-only **String** property||  
|EndRange|Specifies a zero-based integer value corresponding to a **CellOrdinal** attribute value.
