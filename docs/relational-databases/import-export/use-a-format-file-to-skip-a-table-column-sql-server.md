# Use a Format File to Skip a Table Column (SQL Server)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md.md)]

This article describes how to use a format file to skip importing a table column when the data for the skipped column does not exist in the source data file. A data file can contain fewer fields than the number of columns in the destination table - that is, you can skip importing a column - only if at least one of the following two conditions is true in the destination table:
-   The skipped column is nullable.
-   The skipped column has a default value.  
  
## Sample table and data file  
 The examples in this article expect a table named `myTestSkipCol` under the **dbo** schema. You can create this table in a sample database such as *WideWorldImporters* or *AdventureWorks* or in any other database. Create this table as follows:  
  
```sql
USE WideWorldImporters;  
GO  
CREATE TABLE myTestSkipCol   
   (  
   Col1 smallint,  
   Col2 nvarchar(50) NULL,  
   Col3 nvarchar(50) not NULL  
   );  
GO  
```  
  
The examples in this article also use a sample data file, `myTestSkipCol2.dat`. This data file contains only two fields, although the destination table contains three columns.

```  
1,DataForColumn3  
1,DataForColumn3  
1,DataForColumn3  
```  
  
## Basic steps

You can use a non-XML format file or an XML format file to skip a table column. In both cases, there are two steps:

1.   Use the **bcp** command-line utility to create a default format file.

2.   Modify the default format file in a text editor.

The modified format file must map each existing field to its corresponding column in the destination table. It must also indicate which table column or columns to skip. 

For example, to bulk import data from `myTestSkipCol2.dat` into the `myTestSkipCol` table, the format file must map the first data field to `Col1`, skip `Col2`, and map the second field to `Col3`.  
 
## Option #1 - Use a non-XML format file  
  
### Step #1 - Create a default non-XML format file  
Create a default non-XML format file for the `myTestSkipCol` sample table by running the following **bcp** command at the command prompt:  
  
```cmd
bcp WideWorldImporters..myTestSkipCol format nul -f myTestSkipCol_Default.fmt -c -T  
```  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  You might have to specify the name of the server instance to which you are connecting with the `-S` argument. Also, you might have to specify the user name and password with the `-U` and `-P` arguments. For more information, see [bcp Utility](../../tools/bcp-utility.md).  

The previous command creates a non-XML format file, `myTestSkipCol_Default.fmt`. This format file is called a *default format file* because it is the form generated by **bcp**. A default format file describes a one-to-one correspondence between data-file fields and table columns.  
  
 The following screenshot shows the values in this sample default format files. 
  
 ![default non-XML format file for myTestSkipCol](../../relational-databases/import-export/media/mytestskipcol-f-c-default-fmt.gif "default non-XML format file for myTestSkipCol")  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  For more information about the format-file fields, see [Non-XML Format Files &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../relational-databases/import-export/non-xml-format-files-sql-server.md).  
  
### Step #2 - Modify a non-XML format file  
To modify a default non-XML format file, there are two alternatives. Either alternative indicates that the data field does not exist in the data file and that no data is to be inserted into the corresponding table column.

To skip a table column, edit the default non-XML format file and modify the file by using one of the following alternative methods:  

#### Option #1 - Remove the row
The preferred method for skipping a column involves the following three steps:

1.   First, delete any format-file row that describes a field that is missing from the source data file.
2.   Then, reduce the "Host file field order" value of each format-file row that follows a deleted row. The goal is sequential "Host file field order" values, 1 through *n*, that reflect the actual position of each data field in the data file.
3.   Finally, reduce the value in the "Number of columns" field to reflect the actual number of fields in the data file.  
  
The following example is based on the default format file for the `myTestSkipCol` table. This modified format file maps the first data field to `Col1`, skips `Col2`, and maps the second data field to `Col3`. The row for `Col2` has been deleted. The delimiter after the first field has also been changed from `\t` to `,`.
  
```

1       SQLCHAR       0       7       ","      1     Col1         ""  
2       SQLCHAR       0       100     "\r\n"   3     Col3         SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS  
```  
  
#### Option #2 - Modify the row definition

Alternatively, to skip a table column, you can modify the definition of the format-file row that corresponds to the table column. In this format-file row, the "prefix length," "host file data length," and "server column order" values must be set to 0. Also, the "terminator" and "column collation" fields must be set to "" (that is, to an empty or NULL value). The "server column name" value requires a non-blank string, though the actual column name is not necessary. The remaining format fields require their default values.  
  
The following example is also derived from the default format file for the `myTestSkipCol` table.  
  
```  
14.0  
3  
1       SQLCHAR       0       7       ","      1     Col1         ""  
2       SQLCHAR       0       0       ""       0     Col2         ""  
3       SQLCHAR       0       100     "\r\n"   3     Col3         SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS  
```  
  
### Examples with a non-XML format file 
The following examples are based on the `myTestSkipCol` sample table and the `myTestSkipCol2.dat` sample data file that are described earlier in this article.  
  
#### Using BULK INSERT  
This example works by using either of the modified non-XML format files created as described in the preceding section. In this example, the modified format file is named `myTestSkipCol2.fmt`. To use `BULK INSERT` to bulk import the `myTestSkipCol2.dat` data file, in SSMS, run the following code. Update the file system paths for the location of the sample files on your computer.
  
```sql  
USE WideWorldImporters;  
GO  
BULK INSERT myTestSkipCol   
   FROM 'C:\myTestSkipCol2.dat'   
   WITH (FORMATFILE = 'C:\myTestSkipCol2.fmt');  
GO  
SELECT * FROM myTestSkipCol;  
GO  
```  
  
## Option #2 - Use an XML format file  
  
### Step #1 - Create a default XML format file   

Create a default XML format file for the `myTestSkipCol` sample table by running the following **bcp** command at the command prompt:  
  
```cmd
bcp WideWorldImporters..myTestSkipCol format nul -f myTestSkipCol_Default.xml -c -x -T  
```  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  You might have to specify the name of the server instance to which you are connecting with the `-S` argument. Also, you might have to specify the user name and password with the `-U` and `-P` arguments. For more information, see [bcp Utility](../../tools/bcp-utility.md).  
 
The previous command creates an XML format file, `myTestSkipCol_Default.xml`. This format file is called a *default format file* because it is the form generated by **bcp**. A default format file describes a one-to-one correspondence between data-file fields and table columns.  
  
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>  
<BCPFORMAT xmlns="https://schemas.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2004/bulkload/format" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">  
 <RECORD>  
  <FIELD ID="1" xsi:type="CharTerm" TERMINATOR="\t" MAX_LENGTH="7"/>  
  <FIELD ID="2" xsi:type="CharTerm" TERMINATOR="\t" MAX_LENGTH="100" COLLATION="SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS"/>  
  <FIELD ID="3" xsi:type="CharTerm" TERMINATOR="\r\n" MAX_LENGTH="100" COLLATION="SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS"/>  
 </RECORD>  
 <ROW>  
  <COLUMN SOURCE="1" NAME="Col1" xsi:type="SQLSMALLINT"/>  
  <COLUMN SOURCE="2" NAME="Col2" xsi:type="SQLNVARCHAR"/>  
  <COLUMN SOURCE="3" NAME="Col3" xsi:type="SQLNVARCHAR"/>  
 </ROW>  
</BCPFORMAT>  
```  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  For information about the structure of XML format files, see [XML Format Files &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../relational-databases/import-export/xml-format-files-sql-server.md).  

### Step #2 - Modify an XML format file

Here is the modified XML format file, `myTestSkipCol2.xml`, which skips `Col2`. The `FIELD` and `ROW` entries for `Col2` have been removed and the entries have been renumbered. The delimiter after the first field has also been changed from `\t` to `,`.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>  
<BCPFORMAT xmlns="https://schemas.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2004/bulkload/format" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">  
 <RECORD>  
  <FIELD ID="1" xsi:type="CharTerm" TERMINATOR="," MAX_LENGTH="7"/>  
  <FIELD ID="2" xsi:type="CharTerm" TERMINATOR="\r\n" MAX_LENGTH="100" COLLATION="SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS"/>  
 </RECORD>  
 <ROW>  
  <COLUMN SOURCE="1" NAME="Col1" xsi:type="SQLSMALLINT"/>  
  <COLUMN SOURCE="2" NAME="Col3" xsi:type="SQLNVARCHAR"/>  
 </ROW>  
</BCPFORMAT>  
```  
 
### Examples with an XML format file   
The following examples are based on the `myTestSkipCol` sample table and the `myTestSkipCol2.dat` sample data file that are described earlier in this article.

To import the data from `myTestSkipCol2.dat` into the `myTestSkipCol` table, the examples use the modified XML format file, `myTestSkipCol2.xml`.   
  
#### Using BULK INSERT with a view  

With an XML format file, you cannot skip a column when you are importing directly into a table by using a **bcp** command or a `BULK INSERT` statement. However, you can import into all but the last column of a table. If you have to skip any column other than the last column, you must create a view of the target table that contains only the columns contained in the data file. Then, you can bulk import data from that file into the view.  
  
The following example creates the `v_myTestSkipCol` view on the `myTestSkipCol` table. This view skips the second table column, `Col2`. The example then uses `BULK INSERT` to import the `myTestSkipCol2.dat` data file into this view.  
  
In SSMS, run the following code. Update the file system paths for the location of the sample files on your computer. 
  
```sql  
USE WideWorldImporters;  
GO  

CREATE VIEW v_myTestSkipCol AS  
    SELECT Col1,Col3  
    FROM myTestSkipCol;  
GO  
  
BULK INSERT v_myTestSkipCol  
FROM 'C:\myTestSkipCol2.dat'  
WITH (FORMATFILE='C:\myTestSkipCol2.xml');  
GO  
```  

#### Using OPENROWSET(BULK...)  

To use an XML format file to skip a table column by using `OPENROWSET(BULK...)`, you have to provide an explicit list of columns in the select list and also in the target table, as follows:  
  
    ```sql
    INSERT ...<column_list> SELECT <column_list> FROM OPENROWSET(BULK...) 
    ```

The following example uses the `OPENROWSET` bulk rowset provider and the `myTestSkipCol2.xml` format file. The example bulk imports the `myTestSkipCol2.dat` data file into the `myTestSkipCol` table. The statement contains an explicit list of columns in the select list and also in the target table, as required.  
  
In SSMS, run the following code. Update the file system paths for the location of the sample files on your computer.
  
```sql  
USE WideWorldImporters;  
GO  
INSERT INTO myTestSkipCol  
  (Col1,Col3)  
    SELECT Col1,Col3  
      FROM  OPENROWSET(BULK  'C:\myTestSkipCol2.Dat',  
      FORMATFILE='C:\myTestSkipCol2.Xml'    
       ) as t1 ;  
GO  
```
