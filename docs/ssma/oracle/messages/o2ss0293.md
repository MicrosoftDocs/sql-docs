# O2SS0293: Columns list in set clause cannot be converted (Error)

This article describes SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Oracle error message when converting Oracle PL/SQL `UPDATE` statement with column group assignment.

## Background

Oracle PL/SQL allows you to perform multi-column update through sub-query.

SSMA does not support converting `UPDATE` statement with sub-query and generates an error.

## Example

Consider the following example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE ACCOUNT
(
    ACCOUNT_ID NUMBER NOT NULL,
    ACCOUNT_OWNER VARCHAR2(30) NOT NULL
);
/

UPDATE
    ACCOUNT
SET
    (ACCOUNT_ID, ACCOUNT_OWNER) = (SELECT 1, 2 FROM dual)
WHERE
    ACCOUNT_ID = 10;
```

When you try to convert the above code in SSMA, it generates the following error message:

> O2SS0293: Columns list in set clause cannot be converted

## Possible remedies

The above statement can be converted to Transact-SQL as following:

```sql
UPDATE
    acct
SET
    acct.ACCOUNT_ID = updtqry.col1,
    acct.ACCOUNT_OWNER = updtqry.col2
FROM
    ACCOUNT acct,
    (SELECT 1 col1, 2 col2) updtqry
WHERE
    acct.ACCOUNT_ID = 10;
```
