# DSCT00002: Conversion of syntax element is not supported (Error)

This article covers the reason why Database Schema Conversion Toolkit isn't able to convert certain syntax elements.

## Background

When it comes to automated database schema conversion, there are cases when some clauses are not converted. This can be due to multiple different reasons.

The most common are:

1) Conversion of a certain clause isn't yet implemented in the Database Schema Conversion Toolkit
2) Conversion of the clause can't be automated because target platform doesn't provide similar functionality, and this functionality can't be emulated

## Example

To better understand how limitations of the target platform affect the conversion, consider the following table definition:

```sql
CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEES
(
    ID INT NOT NULL,
    NAME VARCHAR2(20),
    DEPARTMENT_ID INT
        REFERENCES DEPARTMENTS (ID)
)
```

When converting this table definition targeting Azure Synapse, a `DSCT00002` error message will be produced, as Azure Synapse doesn't currently support foreign key constraints.

## Possible remedies

Clauses that can't be automatically converted will need to be converted manually.

You may also consider reaching out to [dscthelp@microsoft.com](mailto:dscthelp@microsoft.com?subject=DSCT%20feedback), providing the snippet of the SQL clause that can't be converted currently to help us prioritize the future improvements.

> [!NOTE]
> When migrating from Oracle database to Microsoft SQL platform, you may also consider using [SQL Server Migration Assistant for Oracle](../../../../ssma/oracle/sql-server-migration-assistant-for-oracle-oracletosql.md), which provides automated conversion for an extended set of clauses, but can only be used on Windows.
