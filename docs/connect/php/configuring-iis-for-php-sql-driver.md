# Configuring IIS for PHP SQL Driver
[!INCLUDE[Driver_PHP_Download](../../includes/driver_php_download.md)]

This topic provides links to resources on the [Internet Information Services (IIS) Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=121375) that are relevant to configuring IIS to host PHP applications. The resources listed here are specific to using FastCGI with IIS. FastCGI is a standard protocol that allows an application framework's Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executables to interface with the Web server. FastCGI differs from the standard CGI protocol in that FastCGI re-uses CGI processes for multiple requests.
