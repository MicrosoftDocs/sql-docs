# Define Currency Conversion (Business Intelligence Wizard)
  Use the **Define Currency Conversion** page to review the Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) script that contains the currency conversion functionality generated by the Business Intelligence Wizard. You can then use this wizard-generated MDX script to either overwrite or append the previously-defined currency conversion functionality in the cube's MDX script.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  This page will appear only if the Business Intelligence Wizard detects at least one previously-defined currency conversion in the MDX script for the cube. In the MDX script for a cube, currency conversions are framed with the following comments:  
>   
>  `//<Currency conversion>`  
>   
>  `...`  
>   
>  `[MDX statements for the currency conversion]`  
>   
>  `...`  
>   
>  `//</Currency conversion>`  
>   
>  If you change or remove these comments, the Business Intelligence Wizard may not be able to detect any previously-defined currency conversion.  
  
## Options  
 **New currency conversion script**  
 Displays the MDX script generated by the current Business Intelligence Wizard session.  
  
 **Overwrite existing currency conversion script**  
 Select to overwrite the MDX script displayed in **Existing currency conversion script** with the MDX script displayed in **New currency conversion script**.  
  
 **Append after**  
 Select to append the MDX script displayed in **New currency conversion script** to the end of the MDX script displayed in **Existing currency conversion script**. The appended script appears as a new section.  
  
 **Existing currency conversion script**  
 Select the section of the existing MDX script that contains the previously-defined currency conversion functionality to be overwritten or appended.
