# Extended events for Python in SQL Server Machine Learning
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly.md)]

This section is under development.

> [!NOTE]
> Python support is a new feature in SQL Server 2017 and is in prerelease. Look for more information soon.

In general, you can monitor any external script, including one that runs Python, using the same framework that was provided for R script execution in SQL Server 2016. For more information, see [Extended Events for R Services](../r/extended-events-for-sql-server-r-services.md).
