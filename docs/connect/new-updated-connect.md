# New and Recently Updated: Connect to SQL Server



Nearly every day Microsoft updates some of its existing articles on its [Docs.Microsoft.com](http://docs.microsoft.com/) documentation website. This article displays excerpts from recently updated articles. Links to new articles might also be listed.

This article is generated by a program that is rerun periodically. Occasionally an excerpt can appear with imperfect formatting, or as markdown from the source article. Images are never displayed here.

Recent updates are reported for the following date range and subject:



- *Date range of updates:* &nbsp; **2017-12-03** &nbsp; -to- &nbsp; **2018-02-03**
- *Subject area:* &nbsp; **Connect to SQL Server**.

## Updated Articles with Excerpts

This section displays the excerpts of updates gathered from articles that have recently experienced a large update.

The excerpts displayed here appear separated from their proper semantic context. Also, sometimes an excerpt is separated from important markdown syntax that surrounds it in the actual article. Therefore these excerpts are for general guidance only. The excerpts only enable you to know whether your interests warrant taking the time to click and visit the actual article.

For these and other reasons, do not copy code from these excerpts, and do not take as exact truth any text excerpt. Instead, visit the actual article.

**Retrieve data in parts with SQLGetData**

Before ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server, encrypted character and binary columns cannot be retrieved in parts with SQLGetData. Only one call to SQLGetData can be made, with a buffer of sufficient length to contain the entire column's data.

**Send data in parts with SQLPutData**

Data for insertion or comparison cannot be sent in parts with SQLPutData. Only one call to SQLPutData can be made, with a buffer containing the entire data. For inserting long data into encrypted columns, use the Bulk Copy API, described in the next section, with an input data file.

**Encrypted money and smallmoney**

Encrypted **money** or **smallmoney** columns cannot be targeted by parameters, since there is no specific ODBC data type which maps to those types, resulting in Operand Type Clash errors.

**Bulk Copy of Encrypted Columns**


Use of the [SQL Bulk Copy functions](odbc/../../relational-databases/native-client-odbc-bulk-copy-operations/performing-bulk-copy-operations-odbc.md) and the **bcp** utility is supported with Always Encrypted since ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server. Both plaintext (encrypted on insertion and decrypted on retrieval) and ciphertext (transferred verbatim) can be inserted and retrieved using the Bulk Copy (bcp_*) APIs and the **bcp** utility.

- To retrieve ciphertext in varbinary(max) form (e.g. for bulk loading into a different database), connect without the `ColumnEncryption` option (or set it to `Disabled`) and perform a BCP OUT operation.

- To insert and retrieve plaintext, and let the driver transparently perform encryption and decryption as required, setting `ColumnEncryption` to `Enabled` is sufficient. The functionality of the BCP API is otherwise unchanged.

- To insert ciphertext in varbinary(max) form (e.g. as retrieved above), set the `BCPMODIFYENCRYPTED` option to TRUE and perform a BCP IN operation. In order for the resulting data to be decryptable, ensure that the destination column's CEK is the same as that from which the ciphertext was originally obtained.
