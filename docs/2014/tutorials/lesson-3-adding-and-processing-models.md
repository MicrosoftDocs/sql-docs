# Lesson 3: Adding and Processing Models
  The mining structure that you created in the previous lesson contains a single mining model that is based on the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] Decision Trees algorithm. You can use this model to identify customers for the targeted mailing campaign. However, to ensure that your analysis is thorough, it is a common practice to create related models using different algorithms and compare their results. That way you can get different insights as well. Therefore, you will create two additional models, then process and deploy the models.  
  
 In this lesson, you will create a set of mining models that will suggest the most likely customers from a list of potential customers.  
  
 To complete the tasks in this lesson, you will use the [Microsoft Clustering Algorithm](../../2014/analysis-services/data-mining/microsoft-clustering-algorithm.md) and the [Microsoft Naive Bayes Algorithm](../../2014/analysis-services/data-mining/microsoft-naive-bayes-algorithm.md).  
  
 This lesson contains the following tasks:
