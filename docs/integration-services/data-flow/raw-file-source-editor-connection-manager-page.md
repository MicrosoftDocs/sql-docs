# Raw File Source Editor (Connection Manager Page)
  The Raw File source reads raw data from a file. Because the representation of the data is native to the source, the data requires no translation and almost no parsing. For more information, see [Raw File Source](../../integration-services/data-flow/raw-file-source.md).
