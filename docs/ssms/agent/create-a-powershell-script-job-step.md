# Create a PowerShell Script Job Step
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdbmi-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdbmi-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> On [Azure SQL Database Managed Instance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance), most, but not all SQL Server Agent features are currently supported. See [Azure SQL Database Managed Instance T-SQL differences from SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-transact-sql-information#sql-server-agent) for details.

This topic describes how to create and define a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent job step that executes a PowerShell script in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)].

#### To create a PowerShell Script job step  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer,** connect to an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion_md.md)], and then expand that instance.  
  
2.  Expand **SQL Server Agent**, create a new job or right-click an existing job, and then click **Properties**. For more information on creating a job, see [Creating Jobs](../../ssms/agent/create-jobs.md).  
  
3.  In the **Job Properties** dialog, click the **Steps** page, and then click **New**.  
  
4.  In the **New Job Step** dialog, type a job **Step name**.  
  
5.  In the **Type** list, click **PowerShell**.  
  
6.  In the **Run as** list, select the proxy account with the credentials that the job will use.  
  
7.  In the **Command** box, enter the PowerShell script syntax that will be executed for the job step. Alternately, click **Open** and select a file containing the script syntax. For an example of a PowerShell script, see **Using Transact-SQL** below.  
  
8.  Click the **Advanced** page to set the following job step options: what action to take if the job step succeeds or fails, how many times [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent should try to execute the job step, and how often retry attempts should be made.  
  
## <a name="TSQL"></a>Using Transact-SQL  
  
#### To create a PowerShell Script job step  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer**, connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde_md.md)].  
  
2.  On the Standard bar, click **New Query**.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and click **Execute**.  
  
    ```  
    -- creates a PowerShell job step that finds the processes
    -- that use more than 1000 MB of memory and kills them  
    USE msdb;  
    GO  
    EXEC sp_add_jobstep  
        @job_name = N'Weekly Sales Data Backup',  
        @step_name = N'Kills all processes that use more than 1000 MB of memory',  
        @subsystem = N'PowerShell',  
        @command = N'Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.WS -gt 1000MB } | Stop-Process',   
        @retry_attempts = 5,  
        @retry_interval = 5 ;  
    GO  
    ```

## <a name="SMO"></a>Using SQL Server Management Objects  
**To create a PowerShell Script job step**  
  
Use the **JobStep** class by using a programming language that you choose, such as Visual Basic, Visual C#, or PowerShell.
