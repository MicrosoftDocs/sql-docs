# Activity Monitor
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
  Activity Monitor displays information about [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] processes and how these processes affect the current instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 Activity Monitor is a tabbed document window with the following expandable and collapsible panes: **Overview**, **Active User Tasks**, **Resource Waits**, **Data File I/O**, and **Recent Expensive Queries**. When any pane is expanded, Activity Monitor queries the instance for information. When a pane is collapsed, all querying activity stops for that pane. You can  expand one or more panes at the same time to view different kinds of activity on the instance.  
 
 ## Customize columns 
 For columns included in the **Active User Tasks**, **Resource Waits**, **Data File I/O**, and **Recent Expensive Queries** panes, customize the display as follows:  
  
1.  To rearrange column order, click the column heading and drag it to another location in the heading ribbon.  
  
2.  To sort a column, click the column name.  
  
3.  To filter on one or more columns, click the drop-down arrow in the column heading, and then select a value.
