# sysssislog (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Contains one row for each logging entry that is generated by packages or their tasks and containers at run time. This table is created in the msdb database when you install [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)]. If you configure logging to log to a different [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database, a sysssislog table with this format is created in the specified database.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] writes logging entries in this table **only** when packages use the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] log provider.
