# Deploy an SSIS project with PowerShell
This quick start tutorial demonstrates how to use a PowerShell script to connect to a database server and deploy an SSIS project to the SSIS Catalog.

## PowerShell script
Provide appropriate values for the variables at the top of the following script, and then run the script to deploy the SSIS project.

> [!NOTE]
> The following example uses Windows Authentication. To use SQL Server authentication, replace the `Integrated Security=SSPI;` argument with `User ID=<user name>;Password=<password>;`.

```powershell
# Variables
$SSISNamespace = "Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.IntegrationServices"
$TargetServerName = "localhost"
$TargetFolderName = "Project1Folder"
$ProjectFilePath = "C:\Projects\Integration Services Project1\Integration Services Project1\bin\Development\Integration Services Project1.ispac"
$ProjectName = "Integration Services Project1"

# Load the IntegrationServices assembly
$loadStatus = [System.Reflection.Assembly]::Load("Microsoft.SQLServer.Management.IntegrationServices, "+
    "Version=14.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=89845dcd8080cc91, processorArchitecture=MSIL")

# Create a connection to the server
$sqlConnectionString = `
    "Data Source=" + $TargetServerName + ";Initial Catalog=master;Integrated Security=SSPI;"
$sqlConnection = New-Object System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection $sqlConnectionString

# Create the Integration Services object
$integrationServices = New-Object $SSISNamespace".IntegrationServices" $sqlConnection

# Get the Integration Services catalog
$catalog = $integrationServices.Catalogs["SSISDB"]

# Create the target folder
$folder = New-Object $SSISNamespace".CatalogFolder" ($catalog, $TargetFolderName,
    "Folder description")
$folder.Create()

Write-Host "Deploying " $ProjectName " project ..."

# Read the project file and deploy it
[byte[]] $projectFile = [System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes($ProjectFilePath)
$folder.DeployProject($ProjectName, $projectFile)

Write-Host "Done."
```

## Next steps
- Run a deployed package. To run a package, you can choose from several tools and languages. For more info, see the following articles:
