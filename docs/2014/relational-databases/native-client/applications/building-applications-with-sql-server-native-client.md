# Building Applications with SQL Server Native Client
  When developing an application that uses the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client library, there are a number of issues that come into play. The topics in this section discuss many of these issues including upgrading from MDAC to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client, using the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client header and library files, and an overview of the various connection strings that can be used with [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Installing SQL Server Native Client](installing-sql-server-native-client.md)  
 Discusses how [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client is installed, the locations that various components are installed to, and how to uninstall [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client.  
  
 [Components of SQL Server Native Client](components-of-sql-server-native-client.md)  
 Discusses the components that make up [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client including library, resource, help, and header files.  
  
 [Using Connection String Keywords with SQL Server Native Client](using-connection-string-keywords-with-sql-server-native-client.md)  
 Discusses the various types of connection strings that can be used when connecting to a database through [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client.  
  
 [Using the SQL Server Native Client Header and Library Files](using-the-sql-server-native-client-header-and-library-files.md)  
 Discusses how to use the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client header and library files within an application.  
  
 [Updating an Application to SQL Server Native Client from MDAC](updating-an-application-to-sql-server-native-client-from-mdac.md)  
 Discusses the differences between [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client and MDAC and issues that should be considered when upgrading from MDAC to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client.  
  
 [Updating an Application from SQL Server 2005 Native Client](updating-an-application-from-sql-server-2005-native-client.md)  
 Discusses issues that should be considered when upgrading from [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../../includes/ssversion2005-md.md)] Native Client to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client in [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../../includes/sssql11-md.md)].  
  
 [Using ADO with SQL Server Native Client](using-ado-with-sql-server-native-client.md)  
 Discusses how ADO can use [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client to access and use [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] functionality.  
  
 [Support Policies for SQL Server Native Client](support-policies-for-sql-server-native-client.md)  
 Discusses how various data-access components can be used with different versions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client.  
  
 [Connecting to a Azure SQL Database Using SQL Server Native Client](connecting-to-a-windows-azure-sql-database-using-sql-server-native-client.md)  
 Discusses how to connect to a [!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../../includes/sssds-md.md)] using [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client.
