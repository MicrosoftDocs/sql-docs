# Sessions
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md](../../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md.md)]

[!INCLUDE[Driver_OLEDB_Download](../../../includes/driver_oledb_download.md)]

  An OLE DB Driver for SQL Server session represents a single connection to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 The OLE DB Driver for SQL Server requires that sessions delimit transaction space for a data source. All command objects created from a specific session object participate in the local or distributed transaction of the session object.  
  
 The first session object created on the initialized data source receives the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] connection established at initialization. When all references on the interfaces of the session object are released, the connection to the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] becomes available to another session object created on the data source.  
  
 An additional session object created on the data source establishes its own connection to the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] as specified by the data source. The connection to the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is dropped when the application releases all references to objects created that session.  
  
 The following example demonstrates how to use the OLE DB Driver for SQL Server to connect to a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database:  
  
```  
int main()  
{  
    // Interfaces used in the example.  
    IDBInitialize*      pIDBInitialize      = NULL;  
    IDBCreateSession*   pIDBCreateSession   = NULL;  
    IDBCreateCommand*   pICreateCmd1        = NULL;  
    IDBCreateCommand*   pICreateCmd2        = NULL;  
    IDBCreateCommand*   pICreateCmd3        = NULL;  
  
    // Initialize COM.  
    if (FAILED(CoInitialize(NULL)))  
    {  
        // Display error from CoInitialize.  
        return (-1);  
    }  
  
    // Get the memory allocator for this task.  
    if (FAILED(CoGetMalloc(MEMCTX_TASK, &g_pIMalloc)))  
    {  
        // Display error from CoGetMalloc.  
        goto EXIT;  
    }  
  
    // Create an instance of the data source object.  
    if (FAILED(CoCreateInstance(CLSID_MSOLEDBSQL, NULL,  
        CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER, IID_IDBInitialize, (void**)  
        &pIDBInitialize)))  
    {  
        // Display error from CoCreateInstance.  
        goto EXIT;  
    }  
  
    // The InitFromPersistedDS function   
    // performs IDBInitialize->Initialize() establishing  
    // the first application connection to the instance of SQL Server.  
    if (FAILED(InitFromPersistedDS(pIDBInitialize, L"MyDataSource",  
        NULL, NULL)))  
    {  
        goto EXIT;  
    }  
  
    // The IDBCreateSession interface is implemented on the data source  
    // object. Maintaining the reference received maintains the   
    // connection of the data source to the instance of SQL Server.  
    if (FAILED(pIDBInitialize->QueryInterface(IID_IDBCreateSession,  
        (void**) &pIDBCreateSession)))  
    {  
        // Display error from pIDBInitialize.  
        goto EXIT;  
    }  
  
    // Releasing this has no effect on the SQL Server connection  
    // of the data source object because of the reference maintained by  
    // pIDBCreateSession.  
    pIDBInitialize->Release();  
    pIDBInitialize = NULL;  
  
    // The session created next receives the SQL Server connection of  
    // the data source object. No new connection is established.  
    if (FAILED(pIDBCreateSession->CreateSession(NULL,  
        IID_IDBCreateCommand, (IUnknown**) &pICreateCmd1)))  
    {  
        // Display error from pIDBCreateSession.  
        goto EXIT;  
    }  
  
    // A new connection to the instance of SQL Server is established to support the  
    // next session object created. On successful completion, the  
    // application has two active connections on the SQL Server.

        goto EXIT;  
    }  
  
    // pICreateCmd1 has the data source connection. Because the  
    // reference on the IDBCreateSession interface of the data source  
    // has not been released, releasing the reference on the session

 Connecting OLE DB Driver for SQL Server session objects to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] can generate significant overhead for applications that continually create and release session objects. The overhead can be minimized by managing OLE DB Driver for SQL Server session objects efficiently. OLE DB Driver for SQL Server applications can keep the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] connection of a session object active by maintaining a reference on at least one interface of the object.  
  
 For example, maintaining a pool of command creation object references keeps active connections for those session objects in the pool. As session objects are required, the pool maintenance code passes a valid **IDBCreateCommand** interface pointer to the application method requiring the session. When the application method no longer requires the session, the method returns the interface pointer back to the pool maintenance code rather than releasing the application's reference to the command creation object.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  In the preceding example, the **IDBCreateCommand** interface is used because the **ICommand** interface implements the **GetDBSession** method, the only method in command or rowset scope that allows an object to determine the session on which it was created. Therefore, a command object, and only a command object, allows an application to retrieve a data source object pointer from which additional sessions can be created.
