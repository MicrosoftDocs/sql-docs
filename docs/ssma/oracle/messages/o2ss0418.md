# O2SS0418: Failed to parse statement batch with package definition (Error)

This article describes why SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Oracle does not convert the PL/SQL block when using invalid syntax while creating a package in Oracle code.

## Background

Whenever there is an invalid syntax while creating a package in Oracle code, SSMA generates an error message.

## Example

Consider the example below, in which we have created a package `Empty_Pkg4` with invalid syntax:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE Empty_Pkg4
IS
BEGIN -- error!
    PVT INT := 10;
END;
```

When you try to convert the above code in SSMA, it generates the following error message:

> O2SS0418: Failed to parse statement batch with package definition

## Possible remedies

To resolve this error, you can correct the source code and delete the invalid syntax in Oracle. In our example we have to delete the Begin statement from the Oracle source code as shown below:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE Empty_Pkg4
IS
    PVT INT := 10;
END;
```

Another remedy to consider is verify if any application code calls the package containing the invalid syntax. If not, consider removing the package from your migration project.
