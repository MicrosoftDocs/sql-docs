# Local Audit for SSMS Usage Feedback Collection

SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) contains Internet-enabled features that can collect and send anonymous feature usage data to Microsoft. SSMS may collect standard computer information and information about use and performance that may be transmitted to Microsoft and analyzed for purposes of improving the quality, security, and reliability of SSMS. We do not collect your name, address or other contact information. For details, see the [SQL Server Privacy Statement](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement/SQLServer/Default.aspx).

## Audit feature usage data

To see feature usage data that is collected by SSMS, do the following:
1.	Launch SSMS.
2.	Click **View**, then click **Output** in the main menu to show the **Output** window. 
3.	When the **Output** window is visible, choose **Telemetry** in the **Show output from:** menu.

While you use SSMS to interact with your databases, the **Output** window shows the data that is collected.

## Enable or disable usage feedback collection in SSMS

To opt in or out of usage data collection for SSMS, see: [How to configure SQL Server 2016 to send feedback to Microsoft](http://support.microsoft.com/help/3153756/how-to-configure-sql-server-2016-to-send-feedback-to-microsoft).
