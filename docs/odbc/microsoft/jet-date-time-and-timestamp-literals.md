# Jet: Date, Time, and Timestamp Literals
For maximum interoperability, applications should pass date literals in the ODBC canonical format using escape-clause syntax:  
  
-   For date literals, {d '*value*'}, where *valu*e is in the form "yyyy-mm-dd"  
  
-   For time literals, {t '*value*'}, where *valu*e is in the form "hh:mm:ss"  
  
 For timestamp literals {ts '*value*'}, where *valu*e is in the form "yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss[.f...]".
