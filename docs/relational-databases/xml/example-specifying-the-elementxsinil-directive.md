# Example: Specify the ELEMENTXSINIL directive

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

When you specify the ELEMENT directive to retrieve element-centric XML, if the column has a NULL value, the corresponding element isn't generated by the EXPLICIT mode. You can optionally specify the ELEMENTXSINIL directive to request the generating element for NULL values where the **xsi:nil** attribute is set with the value TRUE.

The following query constructs XML that includes an employee address. For `AddressLine2` and `City` columns, the column names specify the `ELEMENTXSINIL` directive. This generates the element for NULL values in the `AddressLine2` and `City` columns in the rowset.

```sql
USE AdventureWorks2012;
GO
SELECT 1    as Tag,
       NULL as Parent,
       E.BusinessEntityID  as [Employee!1!EmpID],
       BEA.AddressID as [Employee!1!AddressID],
       NULL        as [Address!2!AddressID],
       NULL        as [Address!2!AddressLine1!ELEMENT],
       NULL        as [Address!2!AddressLine2!ELEMENTXSINIL],
       NULL        as [Address!2!City!ELEMENTXSINIL]
FROM   HumanResources.Employee AS E
INNER JOIN Person.BusinessEntityAddress AS BEA
    ON E.BusinessEntityID = BEA.BusinessEntityID

UNION ALL
SELECT 2 as Tag,
       1 as Parent,
       E.BusinessEntityID,
       BEA.AddressID,
       A.AddressID,
       AddressLine1,
       AddressLine2,
       City
FROM   HumanResources.Employee AS E
INNER JOIN Person.BusinessEntityAddress AS BEA
    ON E.BusinessEntityID = BEA.BusinessEntityID
INNER JOIN Person.Address AS A
    ON BEA.AddressID = A.AddressID
ORDER BY [Employee!1!EmpID],[Address!2!AddressID]
FOR XML EXPLICIT;
```

This is the partial result:

```xml
<Employee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          EmpID="1"
          AddressID="249">
  <Address AddressID="249">
    <AddressLine1>4350 Minute Dr.</AddressLine1>
    <AddressLine2 xsi:nil="true" />
    <City>Minneapolis</City>
  </Address>
</Employee>
...
```
