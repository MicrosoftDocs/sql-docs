# Using the SQLXMLOLEDB Provider (SQLXML 4.0)
  The topics in this section provide ADO sample applications that illustrate the use of SQLXMLOLEDB Provider-specific properties.  
  
## Application Requirements for SQLXMLOLEDB 4.0 Provider  
 To create working samples that use SQLXMLOLEDB 4.0, you must do the following:  
  
1.  Create a Microsoft Visual Basic .exe application and add one of the following references:  
  
    -   Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects 2.6 Library  
  
    -   Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects 2.7 Library  
  
    -   Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects 2.8 Library  
  
2.  Deploy and install SQLXML 4.0 and the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client.  
  
     For more information, see on [SQLXML 4.0 Programming Concepts](../../sqlxml/sqlxml-4-0-programming-concepts.md) and [Installing SQL Server Native Client](../../native-client/applications/installing-sql-server-native-client.md).
