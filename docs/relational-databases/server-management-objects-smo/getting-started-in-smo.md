# Getting Started in SMO
  This topic contains links to about topics to help you get started using [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Management Objects (SMO). The following list will help you to locate information about the SMO object hierarchy, how to prepare for writing programs in SMO, how to start writing a SMO program in different programming languages, and general and specific programming tasks.  
 
 **Object Model**  
  
-   The [Object Model](../../relational-databases/server-management-objects-smo/smo-object-model.md) describes the SMO object hierarchy and how the objects relate to one another.  
  
 **Programming Languages**  
  
-   [Programming Languages](../../relational-databases/server-management-objects-smo/smo-programming-languages.md) describes the programming environment and includes detailed procedures to start writing an SMO program in C# and Visual Basic.  
  
 **General Programming in SMO**  
  
-   [General Programming in SMO](../../relational-databases/server-management-objects-smo/create-program/creating-smo-programs.md) is an introduction to programming with SMO. This topic describes how to connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], and how to use properties, methods, and collections. More advanced topics describe data types, transactions, setting the capture mode, and event and exception handling.  
  
 **Programming Specific Tasks**  
  
-   The [Programming Specific Tasks](../../relational-databases/server-management-objects-smo/tasks/programming-specific-tasks.md) section contains concepts and procedures about how to program specific tasks by using SMO. The topic also describes complete programmatic management of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].
