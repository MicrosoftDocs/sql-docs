| 31201 | 16 | No | Property-scoped full-text queries cannot be specified on the specified table because its full-text index is not configured for property searching. To support property-scoped searches, the full-text index must be associated with a search property list and repopulated. The Transact-SQL syntax for this is: ALTER FULLTEXT INDEX ON \<table_name\> SET SEARCH PROPERTY LIST \<property_list_name\>;. |
| 31202 | 10 | No | Reconfiguring the search property list of the full-text index has truncated the existing data in the index. Until the full-text index has been fully repopulated, full-text queries will return partial results. The ALTER FULLTEXT INDEX \<table_name\> SET SEARCH PROPERTY LIST ...; statement automatically issues a full population, but if the ALTER FULLTEXT INDEX statement specified the WITH NO POPULATION clause, you must run a full population on the full-text index using ALTER FULLTEXT INDEX ON \<table_name\> START FULL POPULATION;.

| 33403 | 16 | No | The case-sensitive or binary collation '%.\*ls' cannot be used with the COLLATE_FILENAME option. Change the collation to a case-insensitive collation type. |
| 33404 | 16 | No | The database default collation '%.\*ls' is case sensitive and cannot be used to create a FileTable. Specify a case insensitive collation with the COLLATE_FILENAME option. |
| 33405 | 16 | No | An error occurred during the %S_MSG %S_MSG operation on a FileTable object. (HRESULT = '0x%08x'). |
| 33406 | 16 | No | An invalid filename, '%.\*ls', caused a FileTable check constraint error. Use a valid operating system filename. |
| 33407 | 16 | No | An invalid path locator caused a FileTable check constraint error. The path locator cannot indicate a root row. Correct the path locator or use the default value. |
| 33408 | 16 | No | The operation caused a FileTable check constraint error. A directory entry cannot have a data stream associated with the row. Remove the blob data or clear the is_directory flag. |
| 33409 | 16 | No | The operation caused a FileTable check constraint error. A file entry cannot have a NULL value for the data stream associated with the row. Insert file data or use 0x to insert a zero length file. |
| 33410 | 16 | No | An invalid path locator caused a FileTable check constraint error. The parent of a row's path locator must be a directory, not a file. Correct the path locator to refer to a parent that is a directory. |
| 33411 | 16 | No | The option '%.\*ls' is only valid when used on a FileTable. Remove the option from the statement. |
| 33412 | 16 | No | The option '%.\*ls' is not valid when used with the '%.\*ls' syntax. Remove the option from the statement. |
| 33413 | 16 | No | The option '%.\*ls' can only be specified once in a statement. Remove the duplicate option from the statement. |
| 33414 | 16 | No | FileTable objects require the FILESTREAM database option DIRECTORY_NAME to be non-NULL. To create a FileTable in the database '%.\*ls', set the DIRECTORY_NAME option to a non-NULL value using ALTER DATABASE. Or, to set the DIRECTORY_NAME option to NULL, in the database '%.\*ls' disable or drop the existing FileTables. |
| 33415 | 16 | No | FILESTREAM DIRECTORY_NAME '%.\*s' attempting to be set on database '%.\*s' is not unique in this SQL Server instance. Provide a unique value for the database option FILESTREAM DIRECTORY_NAME to enable non-transacted access. |
| 33416 | 10 | No | When the FILESTREAM database option NON_TRANSACTED_ACCESS is set to FULL and the READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT or the ALLOW_SNAPSHOT_ISOLATION options are on, T-SQL and transactional read access to FILESTREAM data in the context of a FILETABLE is blocked. |
| 33417 | 16 | No | An invalid path locator caused a FileTable check constraint error. The path locator has a level of %d, which is deeper than the limit of %d supported by FileTable. Reduce the depth of the directory hierarchy. |
| 33418 | 16 | No | FILETABLE_DIRECTORY '%.\*s' attempting to be set on table '%.\*s' is not unique in the database '%.\*s'. Provide a unique value for the option FILETABLE_DIRECTORY to this operation. |

| 33438 | 16 | No | Cannot enable Change Tracking on the FileTable '%.\*ls'. Change Tracking is not supported for FileTable objects. |
| 33439 | 16 | No | Cannot use IGNORE_CONSTRAINTS hint when inserting into FileTable '%.\*ls', unless FILETABLE_NAMESPACE is disabled. |
| 33440 | 16 | No | When inserting into FileTable '%.\*ls' using BCP or BULK INSERT, either CHECK_CONSTRAINTS option needs to be on, or FILETABLE_NAMESPACE needs to be disabled on the table. |
| 33441 | 16 | No | The FileTable '%.\*s' cannot be partitioned. Partitioning is not supported on FileTable objects. |
| 33442 | 16 | No | The handle ID %d is opened against the server root share and cannot be killed. The lifetime of the handle is controlled by the client who originally opened it. |
| 33443 | 16 | No | The database '%.\*s' cannot be enabled for both FILESTREAM non-transacted access and Database Mirroring. |
| 33444 | 16 | No | The database '%.\*s' cannot be enabled for both FILESTREAM non-transacted access and HADR. |
| 33445 | 16 | No | The database '%.\*s' is a readable secondary database in an availability group and cannot be enabled for FILESTREAM non-transacted access. |
| 33446 | 16 | No | The FILESTREAM database configuration cannot be changed for database '%.\*s'. The database is either a mirror database in Database Mirroring, or is in a secondary replica of an Always On availability group. Connect to the server instance that hosts the primary database replica, and retry the operation. |
| 33447 | 16 | No | Cannot access file_stream column in FileTable '%.\*ls', because FileTable doesn't support row versioning. Either set transaction level to something other than READ COMMITTED SNAPSHOT or SNAPSHOT, or use READCOMMITTEDLOCK table hint. |
| 33448 | 16 | No | Cannot disable clustered index '%.\*ls' on FileTable '%.\*ls' because the FILETABLE_NAMESPACE is enabled. |
| 33449 | 10 | No | FILESTREAM File I/O access is enabled, but no listener for the availability group is created. A FILESTREAM PathName will be unable to refer to a virtual network name (VNN) and, instead, will need to refer to a physical Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) node. This might limit the usability of FILESTEAM File I/0 access after an availability group failover. Therefore, we recommend that you create a listener for each availability group. For information about how to create an availability group listener, see SQL Server Books Online. |
| 33450 | 10 | No | FILESTREAM File I/O access is enabled. One or more availability groups ('%ls') currently do not have a listener. A FILESTREAM PathName will be unable to refer to a virtual network name (VNN) and, instead, will need to refer to a physical Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) node. This might limit the usability of FILESTEAM File I/0 access after an availability group failover. Therefore, we recommend that you create a listener for each availability group. For information about how to create an availability group listener, see SQL Server Books Online. |
| 33451 | 16 | No | Cannot enable Change Feed on the FileTable '%ls'. Change Feed is not supported for FileTable objects. |
| 33501 | 16 | No | Security predicates cannot be added on tables that contain filestream data. Column '%.\*ls' on table '%.\*ls' contains filestream data. |
| 33502 | 16 | No | The column '%.\*ls' could not be added to table '%.\*ls' because the column contains filestream data and the table is referenced by one or more security policies. Filestream columns are not allowed on tables that are referenced by security policies. |
| 33503 | 16 | No | BLOCK predicates can only be added to user tables. '%.\*ls' is not a user table. |
| 33504 | 16 | No | The attempted operation failed because the target object '%.\*ls' has a block predicate that conflicts with this operation. If the operation is performed on a view, the block predicate might be enforced on the underlying table. Modify the operation to target only the rows that are allowed by the block predicate. |
| 33505 | 16 | No | Partitioned view '%.\*ls' is not updatable because table '%.\*ls' has an enabled security policy that defines block predicates for this table. |
| 33506 | 16 | No | Only natively compiled inline table-valued functions can be used for security predicates on memory optimized tables. Table '%.\*ls' is memory optimized, but function '%.\*ls' is not natively compiled. Recreate the function using WITH NATIVE_COMPILATION. |
| 33507 | 16 | No | Function '%ls' cannot be used in the definition of BLOCK security predicates. Modify the BLOCK security predicates for this table or view to not use this function. |
| 33508 | 16 | No | Column '%.\*ls' cannot be passed as a parameter for a BLOCK security predicate because the column definition contains an expression using a window function. Modify the BLOCK security predicates for this view to not use this column. |
| 33509 | 16 | No | Column '%.\*ls' cannot be passed as a parameter for an AFTER UPDATE or AFTER INSERT BLOCK security predicate for this view because it refers to a base table that is not being modified in this statement. Modify the AFTER INSERT and AFTER UPDATE BLOCK security predicates for this view to not use this column. |
| 33510 | 16 | No | BLOCK security predicates cannot reference history tables. Table '%.\*ls' is a temporal or ledger history table. |
| 33511 | 16 | No | Table '%.\*ls' is memory optimized. Only security policies with schema binding enabled may specify security predicates for memory optimized tables. Create a new security policy with schema binding enabled. |
| 33512 | 16 | No | Binding for the non-schema bound security predicate on object '%.\*ls' failed with one or more errors, indicating the schema of the predicate function has changed. Update or drop the affected security predicates. |
| 33513 | 16 | No | Binding for the non-schema bound security predicate on object '%.\*ls' failed, because the predicate function is not an inline table-valued function. Only inline table-valued functions can be used for security predicates. |
| 33514 | 16 | No | Incorrect encryption metadata was received from the client. The error occurred during the invocation of the batch and therefore the client can refresh the encryption metadata by calling sp_describe_parameter_encryption and retry. |
| 33515 | 16 | No | The parameter "%.\*ls" does not have the same encryption information as the one it was created with. Use sp_refresh_parameter_encryption to refresh the parameter encryption information for the module. |
| 33516 | 16 | No | The object '%.\*ls' is referenced by the security policy '%.\*ls'. The currently installed edition of SQL Server does not support security policies. Either drop the security policy or upgrade the instance of SQL Server to a version that supports security policies. |
| 33517 | 16 | No | The column '%.\*ls' of the object '%.\*ls' is encrypted. The currently installed edition of SQL Server does not support encrypted columns. Either remove the encryption from the column or upgrade the instance of SQL Server to a version that supports encrypted columns. |
| 33518 | 16 | No | Valid values of the database compatibility level are %d, %d, %d, or %d. |
| 33519 | 16 | No | An external data source conflicting with '%.\*ls' already exists in EDS cache in memory. Use alter step to change the location or credential. Drop and re-create to change the EDS name. |
| 33520 | 16 | No | Failed to allocate memory for caching external data source '%.\*ls' which is used by a database file. |
| 33521 | 16 | No | Cannot drop the external data source '%.\*ls' because it is being used. |
| 33522 | 16 | No | Cannot remove the external data source '%.\*ls' because it is being used. |
| 33523 | 16 | No | Cryptographic failure due to insufficient memory. |
| 33524 | 10 | No | The fn_get_audit_file function is skipping records from '%.\*ls'. You must be connected to database '%.\*ls' to access its audit logs. |
| 33525 | 10 | No | The fn_get_audit_file function is skipping records from '%.\*ls'. You must be connected to server '%.\*ls' to access its audit logs. |
| 33526 | 10 | No | The fn_get_audit_file function is skipping records from '%.\*ls', as it does not conform to the auditing blob naming convention. |
| 33527 | 16 | No | Error occurred while initializing the security functions lookup table. This might be because the installation of SQL Server is corrupted and a required file is missing. |
| 33528 | 16 | No | Valid values of the database compatibility level are %d, %d, %d, %d, or %d. |
| 33529 | 16 | No | The audit filter predicate exceeds the maximum allowed length of %d characters. |
| 33530 | 16 | No | The combined length of audit name and blob storage container name exceeds the maximum allowed length (by %d character(s)). Please use shorter audit or container name. |
| 33531 | 16 | No | The specified value for QUEUE_DELAY is not valid with asynchronous log target. Specify value higher than 0. |
| 33532 | 16 | No | Invalid value given for parameter PATH. Please specify a valid blob container path with the following format : https://\<storageName\>.blob.core.windows.net/\<containerName\> |
| 33533 | 16 | No | SHUTDOWN on failure option is not supported in this version of SQL Server. |
| 33534 | 16 | Yes | Internal enclave error. Enclave loading failed: invalid path. For more information, contact Customer Support Services. |
| 33535 | 16 | Yes | Internal enclave error: Enclave call failed for method '%s'. For more information, contact Customer Support Services. |

| 33540 | 16 | No | Invalid audit or database names, please use valid URL characters. |
| 33541 | 16 | No | The credentials of blob storage container '%.\*ls' was not found. |
| 33542 | 16 | No | Unsupported operation near line '%d'; operations on encrypted columns with string data types require a \*_BIN2 or a \*_UTF8 collation. However, the column or the variable uses the '%.\*ls' collation. |
| 33543 | 16 | No | Cannot alter column '%.\*ls'. The statement attempts to encrypt, decrypt or re-encrypt the column in-place using a secure enclave, but the current and/or the target column encryption key for the column is not enclave-enabled. |
| 33544 | 16 | No | Cannot alter column '%.\*ls'. The statement attempts to change the encryption scheme of the column and one or more of the following column properties: collation (to a different code page), data type. Such changes cannot be combined in a single statement. Try using multiple statements. |
| 33545 | 16 | No | The statement requires a secure enclave, but the enclave is not available for the target database - see https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2005337 for more details. |
| 33546 | 16 | No | The statement triggers enclave computations, but a column encryption key, needed for the computations, has not been found inside the enclave. Check that: (1) column encryption and enclave computations are enabled on connection, (2) driver is enclave-enabled. For additional reasons see: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2086681. |

| 33562 | 16 | No | TDE encryption scan state cannot be updated for database id \[%d\]. |
| 33563 | 10 | No | TDE scan for database id \[%d\] was aborted on %S_DATE (UTC). The encryption scan will resume soon. |
| 33564 | 10 | No | TDE scan for database id \[%d\] was suspended on %S_DATE (UTC). To resume scan, run "ALTER DATABASE \[%.\*s\] SET ENCRYPTION RESUME". |
| 33565 | 16 | Yes | Found the certificate \[Cert Hash(sha1) "%hs"\] in the %S_MSG store but the SQL Server service account does not have access to it. |
| 33566 | 16 | Yes | Found the certificate \[Cert Hash(sha1) "%hs"\] in the %S_MSG store but it does not have a private key. Please verify and use a valid certificate. |
| 33567 | 16 | No | Column '%.\*ls.%.\*ls' is encrypted using a randomized encryption type and is therefore not valid for use as a key column in a clustered index, constraint, or statistics. |
| 33568 | 16 | Yes | Internal enclave error: Structured exception within the enclave with status %d. For more information, contact Customer Support Services. |
| 33569 | 16 | No | Column '%.\*ls.%.\*ls' is encrypted with randomized encryption using a collation that is neither \*_BIN2 nor \*_UTF8, and is therefore not valid for use as a key column in an index. |
| 33570 | 10 | No | Specified workload group does not exist. Switching to default workload group for TDE encryption scan. |
| 33571 | 16 | No | Cannot create server audit with GUID '%s' in this version of SQL Server: Please specify another GUID value. |
| 33572 | 16 | No | Encrypted index recovery: %ls %d |
| 33573 | 16 | No | Column '%.\*ls.%.\*ls' is encrypted using randomized encryption with a non enclave-enabled column encryption key and is therefore not valid for use as a key column in a constraint, index, or statistics. |
| 33574 | 16 | No | Specifying a private key file or binary is not allowed when importing or exporting a certificate using the PFX format. |
| 33575 | 16 | No | WITH PRIVATE KEY must be specified when importing or exporting a certificate using the PFX format. |
| 33576 | 16 | No | Invalid certificate encoding FORMAT value provided. The supported values are 'DER' and 'PFX'. |
| 33577 | 16 | No | The specified PFX file or the binary literal cannot be imported as it contains multiple certificates. |
| 33578 | 16 | No | The specified file or the binary literal is not supported as it does not contain a private key. |
| 33579 | 16 | No | Cannot drop a value for the column encryption key '%.\*ls'; dropping the value makes the key enclave disabled, and one or more objects that are schema-bound to column '%.\*ls' depend on it. |
| 33580 | 16 | No | Operation supported by enclaves invoked on data encrypted with randomized encryption where the keys are not enclave-enabled. Please clear the proc cache. |
| 33581 | 16 | No | Cannot alter column '%.\*ls'. The statement attempts to encrypt, decrypt or re-encrypt the column in-place using a secure enclave, but this is not supported for memory-optimized tables. |
| 33582 | 16 | No | Cannot create the module. Executing the module requires keys in a secure enclave, but this is not supported for memory-optimized tables. |

| 35273 | 10 | Yes | Bypassing recovery for database '%ls' because it is marked as an inaccessible availability database. The session with the primary replica was interrupted while reverting the database to the common recovery point. Either the WSFC node lacks quorum or the communications links are broken because of problems with links, endpoint configuration, or permissions (for the server account or security certificate). To gain access to the database, you need to determine what has changed in the session configuration and undo the change. |
| 35274 | 10 | Yes | Recovery for availability database '%ls' is pending until the secondary replica receives additional transaction log from the primary before it complete and come online. Ensure that the server instance that hosts the primary replica is running. |
| 35275 | 16 | Yes | A previous RESTORE WITH CONTINUE_AFTER_ERROR operation or being removed while in the SUSPECT state from an availability group left the '%.\*ls' database in a potentially damaged state. The database cannot be joined while in this state. Restore the database, and retry the join operation. |
| 35276 | 17 | Yes | Failed to allocate and schedule an Always On Availability Groups task for database '%ls'. Manual intervention may be required to resume synchronization of the database. If the problem persists, you might need to restart the local instance of SQL Server. |
