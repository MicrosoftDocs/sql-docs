# Maintain Publications
  After you have created a publication, it might be necessary to add or drop articles, or change publication and article properties. Most changes are allowed after a publication is created, but in some cases, it is necessary to generate a new snapshot for a publication and/or reinitialize subscriptions to the publication.
