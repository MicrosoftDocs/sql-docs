# Static Aggregate Geometry Methods
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

  [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] supports the following aggregate methods as extensions to the static geometry methods of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  These aggregate methods are exposed only in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. They are not exposed in the Microsoft.SqlServer.Types assembly.
