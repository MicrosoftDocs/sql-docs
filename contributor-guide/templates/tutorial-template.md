<!------------------

This is an outline of a tutorial that has high CSAT (https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service-web/web-sites-dotnet-get-started). 

Tutorials show users how to solve a problem. They include prerequisites and steps. They are not "learn concepts" topics. 


GUIDELINES for H1 
	The H1 is the top heading in the article. It tells users what they will do. Use strong keywords: deploy, ASP.NET, web app, App Service, Visual Studio, as you see below. 
	
-------------------->
# Add H1 (top heading) #


<!-----------------
GUIDELINES for Introduction
	1-2 sentences: what users will do and what they will accomplish. Again, use strong keywords.

-------------------->
Add introduction


<!------------------
GUIDELINES for time estimate and diagram 
	Give a time estimate with any useful details. Diagrams are optional but help users see the big picture of what they will do. An optional video of the steps can be used by customers as an alternative to following the steps in the topic. The video doesn't have to be professional. 

-------------------->
Add time estimate and optional diagram and/or video. 


<!------------------
GUIDELINES for prerequisites 
	Include getting started info like setting up an account. List technical expertise and software required. Can also add links to conceptual info.
	
-------------------->
## Prerequisites (H2)

Add prerequisite info. 


<!------------------
GUIDELINES for procedures (steps)
	Format headings as H2’s and make them short and clear – H2’s appear in the right pane on the web page and are important for navigation. Usually begin with a verb: configure, download, etc. to let users know they are doing something. Keep number of steps under 10.

	Screenshots: Really help users understand where they are. Don’t include too many since they’re difficult to maintain. Highlight areas you are referring to in red.

	Next steps: At the end of the procedures give users relevant next steps so they want to go on.

	End of annotations! 

-------------------->

## Procedure title (H2)
