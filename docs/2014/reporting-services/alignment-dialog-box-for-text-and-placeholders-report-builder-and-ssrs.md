# Alignment Dialog Box for Text and Placeholders (Report Builder and SSRS)
  Select the **Alignment** tab to position the values within a selected cell or data region. You can only format the horizontal alignment of individual text within a text box. If you would like to set padding values on the text box or how text is aligned vertically, use the corresponding text box properties. For more information, see [Text Box Properties Dialog Box, Alignment &#40;Report Builder and SSRS&#41;](../../2014/reporting-services/text-box-properties-dialog-box-alignment-report-builder-and-ssrs.md).  
  
## Options  
 **Horizontal**  
 Specify a value or type an expression that evaluates to the position where the text is positioned horizontally within a selected cell or data region. Click the **Expression** (*fx*) button to edit the expression.  
  
-   **General** Display the text as calculated by [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)]. For more information about how general text alignment is calculated, see [Formatting Text and Placeholders &#40;Report Builder and SSRS&#41;](report-design/formatting-text-and-placeholders-report-builder-and-ssrs.md).  
  
-   **Left** Display the text as aligned to the left.  
  
-   **Center** Display the text as aligned in the center.  
  
-   **Right** Display the text as aligned to the right.
