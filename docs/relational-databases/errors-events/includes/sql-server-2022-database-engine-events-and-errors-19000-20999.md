| 19401 | 16 | No | The READ_ONLY_ROUTING_URL '%.\*ls' specified for availability replica '%.\*ls' is not valid. It does not follow the required format of 'TCP://system-address:port'. For information about the correct routing URL format, see the CREATE AVAILABILITY GROUP documentation in SQL Server Books Online. |
| 19402 | 16 | No | A duplicate availability replica '%.\*ls' was specified in the READ_ONLY_ROUTING_LIST for availability replica '%.\*ls'. Inspect the replica list that you specified in your command, and remove the duplicate replica name or names from the list. Then retry the command. |
| 19403 | 16 | No | The availability replica '%.\*ls' specified in the READ_ONLY_ROUTING_LIST for availability replica '%.\*ls' does not exist. Only availability replicas that belong to the specified availability group '%.\*ls' can be added to this list. To get the names of availability replicas in a given availability group, select replica_server_name from sys.availability_replicas and name from sys.availability_groups. For more information, see SQL Server Books Online. |
| 19404 | 16 | No | An availability replica '%.\*ls' that is specified in the READ_ONLY_ROUTING_LIST for availability replica '%.\*ls' does not have a value set for READ_ONLY_ROUTING_URL. Ensure a READ_ONLY_ROUTING_URL is set for each availability replica in the availability group. Specify a valid READ_ONLY_ROUTING_URL for each replica that you want to added to the READ_ONLY_ROUTING_LIST. If you are altering availability replicas of an existing availability group, you can get the names of availability replicas in a given availability group, select replica_server_name from sys.availability_replicas and name from sys.availability_groups. For more information, see SQL Server Books Online. |
| 19405 | 16 | No | Failed to create, join or add replica to availability group '%.\*ls', because node '%.\*ls' is a possible owner for both replica '%.\*ls' and '%.\*ls'. If one replica is failover cluster instance, remove the overlapped node from its possible owners and try again. |
| 19406 | 10 | No | The state of the local availability replica in availability group '%.\*ls' has changed from '%ls' to '%ls'. %ls. For more information, see the SQL Server error log or cluster log. If this is a Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) availability group, you can also see the WSFC management console. |
| [19407](../mssqlserver-19407-database-engine-error.md) | 16 | No | The lease between availability group '%.\*ls' and the Windows Server Failover Cluster has expired. A connectivity issue occurred between the instance of SQL Server and the Windows Server Failover Cluster. To determine whether the availability group is failing over correctly, check the corresponding availability group resource in the Windows Server Failover Cluster. |
| 19408 | 10 | No | The Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) cluster context of Always On Availability Groups has been changed to the remote WSFC cluster, '%.\*ls'. An ALTER SERVER CONFIGURATION SET HADR CLUSTER CONTEXT = 'remote_wsfc_cluster_name' command switched the cluster context from the local WSFC cluster to this remote WSFC cluster. This is an informational message only. No user action is required. |
| 19409 | 10 | No | The Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) cluster context of Always On Availability Groups has been changed to the local WSFC cluster. An ALTER SERVER CONFIGURATION SET HADR CLUSTER LOCAL command switched the cluster context from the remote WSFC cluster, '%.\*ls', to the local WSFC cluster. On this local WSFC cluster, availability databases no longer belong to any availability group, and they are transitioning to the RESTORING state. This is an informational message only. No user action is required. |
| 19410 | 16 | No | An attempt to switch the Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) cluster context of Always On Availability Groups to a remote WSFC cluster failed. This is because one or more availability replicas hosted by the local instance of SQL Server are currently joined to an availability group on the local WSFC cluster. Remove each of the joined replicas from its respective availability group. Then retry your ALTER SERVER CONFIGURATION SET HADR CLUSTER CONTEXT = '%.\*ls' command. |
| 19411 | 16 | No | The specified Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) cluster, '%.\*ls', is not ready to become the cluster context of Always On Availability Groups (Windows error code: %d). The possible reason could be that the specified WSFC cluster is not up or that a security permissions issue was encountered. Fix the cause of the failure, and retry your ALTER SERVER CONFIGURATION SET HADR CLUSTER CONTEXT = 'remote_wsfc_cluster_name' command. |
| 19412 | 16 | No | The ALTER SERVER CONFIGURATION SET HADR CLUSTER CONTEXT = '%.\*ls' command failed. The current Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) cluster context of Always On Availability Groups is already under a remote WSFC cluster. When Always On Availability Groups is running under a remote cluster context, switching to another remote WSFC cluster is not allowed. You can only switch to the local WSFC cluster. |
| 19413 | 16 | No | An attempt to switch Always On Availability Groups to the local Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) cluster context failed. This attempt failed because switching the cluster context back to the local cluster at this time might cause data loss because one or more secondary databases on synchronous-commit replicas are not in the SYNCHRONIZED state. Wait until all synchronous-commit secondary databases are synchronized, and then retry the ALTER SERVER CONFIGURATION SET HADR CLUSTER LOCAL command. |
| 19414 | 16 | No | An attempt to switch the Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) cluster context of Always On Availability Groups to the specified WSFC cluster , '%ls', failed. The cluster context has been switched back to the local WSFC cluster. Check the SQL Server error log for more information. Correct the cause of the error, and repeat the steps for setting up the secondary replicas on the remote WSFC cluster from the beginning. |
| 19415 | 16 | No | Failed to process the registry key value '%.\*ls' (Windows error code: %d), which holds the name of the remote Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) cluster. For more information about this error code, see "System Error Codes" in the Windows Development documentation. Correct the cause of this error, and repeat the steps for setting up the secondary replicas on the remote WSFC cluster from the beginning. |
| 19416 | 16 | No | One or more databases in availability group '%.\*ls' are not synchronized. On a synchronous-commit availability replica, ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP \<group_name\> OFFLINE is not allowed when one or more databases are not synchronized. Wait for all databases to reach the SYNCHRONIZED state, and retry the command. |
| 19417 | 16 | No | An attempt to fail over or create an availability group failed. This operation is not supported when Always On Availability Groups is running under a remote Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) cluster context. Under a remote cluster context, failing over or creating availability groups are not supported. |
| 19418 | 16 | No | The ALTER SERVER CONFIGURATION SET HADR CLUSTER CONTEXT = '%.\*ls' command failed because the local Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) cluster name,'%.\*ls', was specified. Retry the command, specifying the name of a remote WSFC cluster. |
| [19419](../mssqlserver-19419-database-engine-error.md) | 16 | No | Windows Server Failover Cluster did not receive a process event signal from SQL Server hosting availability group '%.\*ls' within the lease timeout period. |
| 19420 | 10 | No | The availability group '%.\*ls' is being asked to stop the lease renewal because the availability group is going offline. This is an informational message only. No user action is required. |
| [19421](../mssqlserver-19421-database-engine-error.md) | 16 | No | SQL Server hosting availability group '%.\*ls' did not receive a process event signal from the Windows Server Failover Cluster within the lease timeout period. |
| 19422 | 16 | No | The renewal of the lease between availability group '%.\*ls' and the Windows Server Failover Cluster failed because SQL Server encountered Windows error with error code ('%d'). |
| 19423 | 16 | No | The lease of availability group '%.\*ls' lease is no longer valid to start the lease renewal process. |
| 19424 | 10 | No | The lease worker of availability group '%.\*ls' is now sleeping the excess lease time (%u ms) supplied during online. This is an informational message only. No user action is required. |
| 19431 | 16 | No | Always On Availability Groups transport for availability database "%.\*ls" has hit flow control boundary with log block whose LSN is %S_LSN. This error happens when secondary replica doesn't have buffer to receive a new message from primary. This is an informational message only. No user action is required. |
| 19432 | 16 | No | Always On Availability Groups transport has detected a missing log block for availability database "%.\*ls". LSN of last applied log block is %S_LSN. Log scan will be restarted to fix the issue. This is an informational message only. No user action is required. |
| 19433 | 16 | No | Always On: AG integrity check failed to find AG name to ID map entry with matching group ID for AG '%.\*ls' (expected: '%.\*ls'; found '%.\*ls'). |
| 19434 | 16 | No | Always On: AG integrity check failed to find AG name to ID map entry with matching resource ID for AG '%.\*ls' (expected: '%.\*ls'; found '%.\*ls'). |
| 19435 | 16 | No | Always On: AG integrity check failed for AG '%.\*ls' with error %d, severity %d, state %d. |
| 19436 | 16 | No | Always On: A failure \[%d\] was encountered while waiting for LSN %S_LSN to be hardened on the Commit Manager \[%d\] for database ID \[%d\] on partner ID \[%s\]. |
| 19450 | 16 | No | Failed to open a cluster network interface object: '%ls'. The WSFC cluster control API returned error code %d. The WSFC service may not be running or may be inaccessible in its current state. For information about this error code, see "System Error Codes" in the Windows Development documentation. |
| 19451 | 16 | No | '%.\*ls' and '%.\*ls' belong to the same subnet. Only one IPv4 and/or one IPv6 address from each subnet is allowed. For an advanced configuration, see the Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) administrator to create a customized configuration through the Cluster Manager. |
| 19452 | 16 | No | The availability group listener (network name) with Windows Server Failover Clustering resource ID '%s', DNS name '%s', port %hu failed to start with a permanent error: %u. Verify port numbers, DNS names and other related network configuration, then retry the operation. |
| 19453 | 16 | No | The availability group listener (network name) with resource ID '%s', DNS name '%s', port %hu failed to start with this error: %u. Verify network and cluster configuration and logs. |
| 19454 | 16 | No | The availability group listener (network name) with resource ID '%s', DNS name '%s', port %hu failed to stop with this error: %u. Verify network and cluster configuration and logs. |
| 19455 | 16 | No | The WSFC cluster does not have a public cluster network with an IPv4 subnet. This is a requirement to create an availability group DHCP listener. Configure a public network for the cluster with an IPv4 subnet, and try to create the listener. |
| 19456 | 16 | No | None of the IP addresses configured for the availability group listener can be hosted by the server '%.\*ls'. Either configure a public cluster network on which one of the specified IP addresses can be hosted, or add another listener IP address which can be hosted on a public cluster network for this server. |
| 19457 | 16 | No | The specified IP Address '%.\*ls' is not valid in the cluster-allowed IP range. Check with the network administrator to select values that are appropriate for the cluster-allowed IP range. |
| 19458 | 16 | No | The WSFC nodes that host the primary and secondary replicas belong to different subnets. DHCP across multiple subnets is not supported for availability replicas. Use the static IP option to configure the availability group listener. |
| 19459 | 16 | No | The listener with DNS name '%.\*ls' does not conform to SQL Server listener guidelines, and cannot be configured through SQL Server. Reconfigure the listener through the WSFC Cluster Manager. |
| 19460 | 16 | No | The availability group listener with DNS name '%.\*ls' is configured to use DHCP. For listeners with this configuration, IP addresses cannot be added through SQL Server.

| 20648 | 16 | No | An article already exists for table "%s" with a different value for the @delete_tracking property. The value must be the same for all publications in which the table is published. Use the stored procedures sp_helpmergearticle and sp_changemergearticle to view and modify the property in the other article(s). |
| 20649 | 16 | No | Publications enabled for heterogeneous subscriptions do not support %s. Please change the '%s' parameter value. |
| 20650 | 16 | No | Cannot enable data definition language (DDL) replication (a value of "true" for the @replicate_ddl parameter) for publication "%s". This is because the compatibility level of the publication is lower than 90RTM. For new publications, in the stored procedure sp_addmergepublication, set the @publication_compatibility_level parameter to 90RTM; for existing publications, use sp_changemergepublication. |
| 20651 | 16 | No | Publication "%s" "%s". Therefore the compatibility level of the publication cannot be set to lower than %d. To set the compatibility level lower, disable the feature and then call the stored procedure sp_changemergepublication to lower the compatibility level. |
| 20652 | 16 | No | Required metadata for publication '%s' could not be found in the sysmergeschemachange system table. Run the Snapshot Agent again. |
| 20653 | 16 | No | Cannot have a dynamic snapshot job with both dynamic_filter_login and dynamic_filter_hostname being NULL. |

| 20661 | 16 | No | The republisher's republishing range obtained from its publisher is not large enough to allocate the specified @identity_range. |
| 20662 | 16 | No | The republisher does not have a range of identity values from the root Publisher '%s' that it can assign to its Subscribers. Ensure that the republisher has a server subscription to the publication at the root Publisher, and then run the Merge Agent to synchronize with the root Publisher. |
| 20663 | 16 | No | The identity range allocation entry for the Publisher could not be found in the system table MSmerge_identity_range. Ensure that the value for the @identityrangemanagementoption property is "auto". |
| 20664 | 16 | No | The Publisher cannot be assigned a new range of identity values, because the values for the identity column's data type have all been used. Change the data type in the identity column. |
| 20665 | 16 | No | The republisher does not have a range of identity values from the root Publisher that it can assign to its Subscribers. Run the Merge Agent to synchronize with the root Publisher. |
| 20666 | 16 | No | Cannot refresh the identity range and/or the check constraint on the Publisher. Ensure the following: that the value in the identity column has not reached the maximum for the data type in the identity column; and that the user who made the last insert has the privileges to drop and re-create the check constraint. |
| 20667 | 16 | No | Cannot allocate an identity range for article "%s". The article is not enabled for automatic identity range management. |
| 20668 | 16 | No | Not enough range available to allocate a new range for a subscriber. |
| 20669 | 16 | No | Object referenced by the given @article or @artid '%s' could not be found. |
| 20670 | 16 | No | Cannot add, drop, or alter the identity range check constraint for table %s. This constraint is used by replication for automatic identity range management. This error typically occurs if the user who made the last insert in the table does not have permission to make schema changes on the table. If this error occurs at the Publisher, run sp_adjustpublisheridentityrange; if it occurs at the Subscriber, run the Merge Agent. |
| 20671 | 16 | No | Cannot find the identity range allocation entry for the Subscriber in the MSmerge_identity_range table. Reinitialize the subscription. |
| 20672 | 16 | No | A value for the parameter @host_name was specified, but no articles in the publication use HOST_NAME() for parameterized filtering. |
| 20673 | 16 | No | A value for the parameter @host_name was specified, but no articles in the publication use SUSER_SNAME() for parameterized filtering. |
| 20674 | 16 | No | The publication does not use dynamic filtering. |
| 20675 | 16 | No | The identity range values cannot be NULL. |
| 20676 | 11 | No | Cannot refresh the Publisher identity range for article "%s". Execute the stored procedure sp_adjustpublisheridentityrange to refresh the identity range. |
| 20677 | 11 | No | Cannot add article "%s" with automatic identity range management. The article is already published in a transactional publication with automatic identity range management. |
| 20678 | 11 | No | Could not find the regular snapshot job for the specified publication '%s'. |
| 20679 | 11 | No | Cannot execute the stored procedure sp_adjustpublisheridentityrange on the current database because the database is a republisher or a Subscriber. To adjust the identity range at a republisher or a Subscriber, synchronize with the root Publisher. |
| 20680 | 16 | No | Failed to get metadata for a batch of rows. |
| 20681 | 10 | No | Cannot specify a value of 1, 2, or 3 for the parameter @partition_options because publication "%s" has a compatibility level lower than 90RTM. Use the stored procedure sp_changemergepublication to set publication_compatibility_level to 90RTM. |
| 20682 | 10 | No | Failed deletion of rows in batched delete attempt on table %s. |
| 20683 | 16 | No | Failed batched deletion on download only article %s. |
| 20684 | 16 | No | Deleted more rows than expected in the batched delete attempt on table %s. Stop and restart the Merge Agent. |

| 20688 | 16 | No | The tracer token ID (%d) could not be found for Publisher %s, database %s, publication %s. Use the stored procedure sp_helptracertokens to retrieve a list of valid tracer token IDs. |
| 20689 | 16 | No | The check for a Publisher needing a new identity range allocation failed on table %s. This check occurs every time the Merge Agent and Snapshot Agent run. Rerun the Merge Agent or Snapshot Agent. |
| 20690 | 16 | No | Cannot set up the Publisher identity range for table %s. Verify that appropriate ranges were specified when the article was created, and then rerun the Snapshot Agent. |
| 20691 | 16 | No | Merge replication upgrade of SQL Server 2005 metadata and triggers on the subscriber failed. |
| 20692 | 16 | No | One or more rows to be inserted in the batch insert procedure for table %s were present in MSmerge_tombstone; merge replication cannot use batch insert. This typically occurs when rows move from one partition to another. No action is required, but if this condition occurs frequently, verify that data is partitioned optimally. Batch insert can improve the performance of merge replication. |
| 20693 | 16 | No | One or more rows to be inserted in the batch insert procedure for table %s were present in MSmerge_contents; merge replication cannot use batch insert. This typically occurs when rows move from one partition to another. No action is required, but if this condition occurs frequently, verify that data is partitioned optimally. Batch insert can improve the performance of merge replication. |
| 20694 | 16 | No | One or more rows to be updated for table %s contain changes in the column %s, which is used in one or more filters; merge replication cannot use batch processing for these changes. No action is required, but if this condition occurs frequently, verify that data is partitioned optimally. Batch updates can improve the performance of merge replication. |
| 20695 | 16 | No | Only %ld out of %ld rows were updated in the batched update procedure for table %s; other rows could not be updated because they have been deleted. No action is required, but if this condition occurs frequently, determine if update-delete conflicts can be avoided. Batch updates can be helpful for performance. |
| 20696 | 16 | No | The object %s is marked as shipped by Microsoft (ms_shipped). It cannot be added as an article for merge replication. |
| 20697 | 16 | No | Cannot drop article %s from publication %s. In this publication, this is the only article that uses a parameterized filter.
