## Documentation Policy for SQL Server Support and Upgrade  
Content that appears in SQL Server documentation is published only after it has been tested sufficiently. Product documentation - SQL Server Books Online, readme files, known issues documents, and Knowledge Base articles - contains content regarding SQL Server features and functionality that is robust enough to be safe for general use by all customers. This policy applies to all SQL Server documentation, including readme files for releases and services packs; a readme file is considered an extension of Books Online.  
  
In some cases, a particular feature is not something that customers should use directly and, therefore, it is not documented. Unless a feature is also discussed in SQL Server documentation published by Microsoft, content from third-party books or Web sites is not supported by Microsoft customer support, and should not be used in production databases or applications.  
  
Customers must not use undocumented APIs, including but not limited to: stored procedures, extended stored procedures, functions, views, tables, columns, properties, or metadata. Microsoft customer support does not support databases or applications that leverage or use undocumented entry points.  
  
Server and database upgrades to future versions of SQL Server are not guaranteed for applications and databases that leverage and use undocumented entry points. Use of SQL Server features and functionality must be limited to those that are included in Microsoft SQL Server documentation. If a feature is not documented in Microsoft SQL Server documentation, it is not a supported part of SQL Server.
