# Navigate Code and Text
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md.md)]
  You can move through text by using:  
  
-   Bookmarks.  
  
-   Incremental search.  
  
-   Mouse and navigation keys.  
  
-   The **Go To** command.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  For a complete list of keyboard shortcut keys, see [SQL Server Management Studio Keyboard Shortcuts](../../tools/sql-server-management-studio/sql-server-management-studio-keyboard-shortcuts.md).  
  
## Navigating with Bookmarks  
 To edit a document elsewhere and then return to your original location, add a bookmark. You set bookmarks and move to them using keyboard shortcuts. View the bookmarks in the bookmark window.  
  
## Incremental Search  
 Incremental search helps you navigate directly to locations in the current document as you enter the search characters. You can access incremental search with keyboard shortcuts.  
  
## Navigating with the Mouse and Keyboard  
 The most common way to navigate text is with the mouse and navigation keys:  
  
-   Use the LEFT ARROW and RIGHT ARROW keys to move one character at a time or in combination with the CTRL key to move one word at a time. The UP ARROW and DOWN ARROW keys move one line at a time.  
  
-   Click a location to place the cursor there.  
  
-   Use the scroll bars or scroll wheel on the mouse to move through the text.  
  
-   Use the HOME, END, PAGE UP, and PAGE DOWN keys to move through the text.  
  
-   Use CTRL+PAGE UP and CTRL+PAGE DOWN to move the insertion point to the top or bottom of the window, respectively.  
  
-   Use CTRL+UP ARROW and CTRL+DOWN ARROW to scroll the view without moving the insertion point.  
  
## Go To Command  
 Use the **GoTo** command to go to a specific line number. To make line numbering visible, in the **Options** dialog box, click **Text Editor**, click **All Languages**, click **General**, and then select **Line numbers**.  
  
 **To go to a specific line number**  
  
1.  Click **Go To** on the **Edit** menu  
  
2.  Enter the line number you want to view
