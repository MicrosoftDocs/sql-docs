# Configuring RDS
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Beginning with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, RDS server components are no longer included in the Windows operating system (see Windows 8 and [Windows Server 2012 Compatibility Cookbook](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=27416) for more detail). RDS client components will be removed in a future version of Windows. Avoid using this feature in new development work, and plan to modify applications that currently use this feature. Applications that use RDS should migrate to [WCF Data Service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=199565).  
  
 To implement RDS efficiently, be sure you are familiar with the various configurations available to you. This section includes important information about security and scalability in your implementation of RDS. See the following topics for information about configuring your computers to use RDS.
