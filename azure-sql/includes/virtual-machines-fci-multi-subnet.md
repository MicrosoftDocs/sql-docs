> [!TIP]
> Simplify your deployment and eliminate the need for an Azure Load Balancer or distributed network name (DNN) for your failover cluster instance by creating your SQL Server virtual machines (VMs) in [multiple subnets](../virtual-machines/windows/failover-cluster-instance-prepare-vm.md#subnets) within the same Azure virtual network.
