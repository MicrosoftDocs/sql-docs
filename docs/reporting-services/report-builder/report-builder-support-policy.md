# Microsoft Report Builder support policy

The support policy for Microsoft Report Builder is as follows.

- Starting with Microsoft Report Builder 15.0, the SQL Server Reporting Services team has adopted the [Microsoft Modern Lifecycle Policy](/lifecycle/policies/modern).
- Read the original [Modern Lifecycle Policy announcement](/lifecycle/announcements/modern-policy).
- For more information, see the [Modern Policy FAQ](/lifecycle/faq/modern-policy).

## Microsoft Report Builder updates

Beginning with version 15.0, all security updates, critical updates, hotfixes, as well as any new features will be released only in the latest point version of the major version. Once a new version of Microsoft Report Builder is released for public, whether it's a point version within a major version or a major version itself, all prior versions are out of support, as per the [Modern Lifecycle Policy](/lifecycle/policies/modern).

For the best experience, we recommend that customers install the most recent version of [Microsoft® Report Builder](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53613) from Official Microsoft Download Center.

### Full Support servicing phase

When you're running the latest current branch version of Microsoft Report Builder, you receive all updates: 

- Security updates.
- Critical updates.
- New features
- And so on.
