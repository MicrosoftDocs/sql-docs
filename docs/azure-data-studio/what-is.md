# What is Azure Data Studio?

Azure Data Studio is a cross-platform database tool for data professionals using the Microsoft family of on-premises and cloud data platforms on Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

Previously released under the preview name SQL Operations Studio, Azure Data Studio offers a modern editor experience with Intellisense, code snippets, source control integration, and an integrated terminal. It is engineered with the data platform user in mind, with built in charting of query result sets and customizable dashboards.

## Transact-SQL (T-SQL) code editor with IntelliSense

[!INCLUDE[name-sos](../includes/name-sos-short.md)] offers a modern, keyboard-focused T-SQL coding experience that makes your everyday tasks easier with built-in features, such as multiple tab windows, a rich T-SQL editor, IntelliSense, keyword completion, code snippets, code navigation, and source control integration (Git). Run on-demand T-SQL queries, view and save results as text, JSON, or Excel. Edit data, organize your favorite database connections, and browse database objects in a familiar object browsing experience. To learn how to use the T-SQL editor, see [Use the T-SQL editor to create database objects](tutorial-sql-editor.md).

## Smart T-SQL code snippets

T-SQL code snippets generate the proper T-SQL syntax to create databases, tables, views, stored procedures, users, logins, roles, etc., and to update existing database objects. Use smart snippets to quickly create copies of your database for development or testing purposes, and to generate and execute CREATE and INSERT scripts.

[!INCLUDE[name-sos](../includes/name-sos-short.md)] also provides functionality to create custom T-SQL code snippets. To learn more, see [Create and use code snippets](code-snippets.md).


## Customizable Server and Database Dashboards

Create rich customizable dashboards to monitor and quickly troubleshoot performance bottlenecks in your databases. To learn about insight widgets, and database (and server) dashboards, see [Manage servers and databases with insight widgets](insight-widgets.md).

## Connection management (server groups)

Server groups provide a way to organize connection information for the servers and databases you work with. For details, see [Server groups](server-groups.md).

## Integrated Terminal

Use your favorite command-line tools (for example, Bash, PowerShell, sqlcmd, bcp, and ssh) in the Integrated Terminal window right within the [!INCLUDE[name-sos](../includes/name-sos-short.md)] user interface. To learn about the integrated terminal, see [Integrated terminal](integrated-terminal.md).

## Extensibility and extension authoring

Enhance the [!INCLUDE[name-sos](../includes/name-sos-short.md)] experience by extending the functionality of the base installation. [!INCLUDE[name-sos](../includes/name-sos-short.md)] provides extensibility points for data management activities, as well as support for extension authoring.

To learn about extensibility in [!INCLUDE[name-sos](../includes/name-sos-short.md)], see [Extensibility](extensibility.md).
To learn about authoring extensions, see [Extension authoring](extension-authoring.md).
