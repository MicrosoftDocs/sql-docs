# Start a Trace Automatically after Connecting to a Server (SQL Server Profiler)
  This topic describes how to start traces automatically after connecting to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../includes/sssqlprofiler-md.md)].  
  
### To start a trace automatically after connecting to a server with SQL Server Profiler  
  
1.  On the **Tools** menu, click **Options**.  
  
2.  Select the **Start tracing immediately after making a connection** check box.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If **Start tracing immediately after making connection**is selected, the **Trace Properties**dialog box fails to appear and the trace begins instead. To edit trace properties, you must first turn this setting off.
