# Working with SSMA for Sybase Console (SybaseToSQL)
[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Migration Assistant (SSMA), release for Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE), is now accessible through a console application at command line. The script files form the input to the application for executing the commands. As a console application, SSMA enables script-level interfacing, reduces the migration cycle, and scales the migration effort.  
  
This section explains the procedure to migrate the ASE database using the SSMA Console application.  
  
Topics covered in this section include:
