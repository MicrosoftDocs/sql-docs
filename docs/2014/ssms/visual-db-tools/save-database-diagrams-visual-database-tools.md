# Save Database Diagrams (Visual Database Tools)
  By saving a database diagram, you can save all the changes you made to it, including any changes you made to the tables, columns, and other database objects.  
  
### To save the database diagram  
  
1.  From the **File** menu, choose **Save <*`tablename`*>**.  
  
2.  If this is a new diagram that you have never before saved, the **Save As** dialog box appears. Type a name for the diagram.  
  
     If you made changes to tables in an existing diagram, the **Save** dialog box appears and displays a list of changes that will be saved in the database when you save your diagram.  
  
3.  Click **Yes** (or **OK** if this is a new diagram) to update the database to match your diagram.
