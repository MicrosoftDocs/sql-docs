# DTCTransaction Event Class
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server - ASDB](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb.md)]
  Use the **DTCTransaction** event class to monitor the state of [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] transactions coordinated through [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Distributed Transaction Coordinator (DTC). This includes transactions involving two or more databases in the same instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)], or distributed transactions involving two or more instances of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
## DTCTransaction Event Class Data Columns  
  
|Data column name|Data type|Description|Column ID|Filterable|  
|----------------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|  
|**ApplicationName**|**nvarchar**|Name of the client application that created the connection to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. This column is populated with the values passed by the application rather than the displayed name of the program.|10|Yes|  
|**BinaryData**|**image**|Binary representation of the Unit of Work ID (UOW) that uniquely identifies this transaction within DTC.|2|Yes|  
|**ClientProcessID**|**int**|ID assigned by the host computer to the process where the client application is running. This data column is populated if the client provides the client process ID.|9|Yes|  
|**DatabaseID**|**int**|ID of the database specified by the USE *database* statement or the default database if no USE *database* statement has been issued for a given instance. [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../includes/sssqlprofiler-md.md)] displays the name of the database if the **ServerName** data column is captured in the trace and the server is available. Determine the value for a database by using the DB_ID function.|3|Yes|  
|**DatabaseName**|**nvarchar**|Name of the database in which the user statement is running.|35|Yes|  
|**EventClass**|**int**|Type of event = 19.|27|No|  
|**EventSequence**|**int**|Sequence of a given event within the request.|51|No|  
|**EventSubClass**|**int**|Type of event subclass.<br /><br /> 0=Get address<br /><br /> 1=Propagate Transaction<br /><br /> 3=Close connection<br /><br /> 6=Creating a new DTC transaction<br /><br /> 7=Enlisting in a DTC transaction<br /><br /> 9=Internal commit<br /><br /> 10=Internal abort<br /><br /> 14=Preparing Transaction<br /><br /> 15=Transaction is prepared<br /><br /> 16=Transaction is aborting<br /><br /> 17=Transaction is committing<br /><br /> 22=TM failed while in prepared state<br /><br /> 23=Unknown|21|Yes|  
|**GroupID**|**int**|ID of the workload group where the SQL Trace event fires.|66|Yes|  
|**HostName**|**nvarchar**|Name of the computer on which the client is running. This data column is populated if the client provides the host name. To determine the host name, use the HOST_NAME function.|8|Yes|  
|**IntegerData**|**int**|Isolation level of the transaction.|25|Yes|  
|**IsSystem**|**int**|Indicates whether the event occurred on a system process or a user process. 1 = system, 0 = user.|60|Yes|  
|**LoginName**|**nvarchar**|Name of the login of the user (either the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] security login or the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Windows login credentials in the form of DOMAIN\username).|11|Yes|  
|**LoginSid**|**image**|Security identification number (SID) of the logged-in user. You can find this information in the **sys.server_principals** catalog view. Each SID is unique for each login in the server.|41|Yes|  
|**NTDomainName**|**nvarchar**|Windows domain to which the user belongs.|7|Yes|  
|**NTUserName**|**nvarchar**|Windows user name.|6|Yes|  
|**RequestID**|**int**|ID of the request containing the statement.|49|Yes|  
|**ServerName**|**nvarchar**|Name of the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] being traced.|26|No|  
|**SessionLoginName**|**nvarchar**|Login name of the user who originated the session. For example, if you connect to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] using Login1 and execute a statement as Login2, **SessionLoginName** shows Login1 and **LoginName** shows Login2. This column displays both [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and Windows logins.|64|Yes|  
|**SPID**|**int**|ID of the session on which the event occurred.|12|Yes|  
|**StartTime**|**datetime**|Time at which the event started, when available.|14|Yes|  
|**TextData**|**ntext**|Textual representation of the UOW that uniquely identifies this transaction within DTC.|1|Yes|  
|**TransactionID**|**bigint**|System-assigned ID of the transaction.|4|Yes|  
|**XactSequence**|**bigint**|Token used to describe the current transaction.|50|Yes|
