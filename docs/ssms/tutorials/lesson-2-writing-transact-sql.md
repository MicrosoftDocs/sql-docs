# Lesson 2: Writing Transact-SQL
[!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] is an integrated development environment for writing [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)], MDX, DMX, and XML queries, and SQLCMD commands. The tutorial illustrates using the Database Engine Query Editor to write a [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] script.
