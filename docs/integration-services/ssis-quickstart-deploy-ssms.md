# Deploy an SSIS project with SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
This quick start demonstrates how to use SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to connect to the SSIS Catalog database, and then run the Integration Services Deployment Wizard to deploy an SSIS project to the SSIS Catalog. 

SQL Server Management Studio is an integrated environment for managing any SQL infrastructure, from SQL Server to SQL Database. For more info about SSMS, see [SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](../ssms/sql-server-management-studio-ssms.md).

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the latest version of SQL Server Management Studio. To download SSMS, see [Download SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms).

## Connect to the SSISDB database

Use SQL Server Management Studio to establish a connection to the SSIS Catalog. 

> [!NOTE]
> An Azure SQL Database server listens on port 1433. If you're trying to connect to an Azure SQL Database server from within a corporate firewall, this port must be open in the corporate firewall for you to connect successfully.

1. Open SQL Server Management Studio.

2. In the **Connect to Server** dialog box, enter the following information:

   | Setting       | Suggested value | More info | 
   | ------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | 
   | **Server type** | Database engine | This value is required. |
   | **Server name** | The fully qualified server name | If you're connecting to an Azure SQL Database server, the name is in this format: `<server_name>.database.windows.net`. |
   | **Authentication** | SQL Server Authentication | This quickstart uses SQL authentication. |
   | **Login** | The server admin account | This is the account that you specified when you created the server. |
   | **Password** | The password for your server admin account | This is the password that you specified when you created the server. |

3. Click **Connect**. The Object Explorer window opens in SSMS. 

4. In Object Explorer, expand **Integration Services Catalogs** and then expand **SSISDB** to view the objects in the SSIS Catalog database.

## Start the Integration Services Deployment Wizard
1. In Object Explorer, with the **Integration Services Catalogs** node and the **SSISDB** expanded, expand a project folder.

2.  Select the **Projects** node.

3.  Right-click on the **Projects** node and select **Deploy project**. The Integration Services Deployment Wizard opens. You can deploy a project from the current catalog or from the file system.

## Deploy a project with the wizard
1. On the **Introduction** page of the wizard, review the introduction. Click **Next** to open the **Select Source** page.

2. On the **Select Source** page, select the existing SSIS project to deploy.
    -   To deploy a project deployment file that you created, select **Project deployment file** and enter the path to the .ispac file.
    -   To deploy a project that resides in an SSIS catalog, select **Integration Services catalog**, and then enter the server name and the path to the project in the catalog.
    Click **Next** to see the **Select Destination** page.
  
3.  On the **Select Destination** page, select the destination for the project.
    -   Enter the fully-qualified server name. If the target server is an Azure SQL Database server, the name is in this format: `<server_name>.database.windows.net`.
    -   Then click **Browse** to select the target folder in SSISDB.
    Click **Next** to open the **Review** page.  
  
4.  On the **Review** page, review the settings you selected.
    -   You can change your selections by clicking **Previous**, or by clicking any of the steps in the left pane.
    -   Click **Deploy** to start the deployment process.
  
5.  After the deployment process is complete, the **Results** page opens. This page displays the success or failure of each action.
    -   If the action failed, click **Failed** in the **Result** column to display an explanation of the error.
    -   Optionally, click **Save Report...** to save the results to an XML file.
    -   Click **Close** to exit the wizard.
