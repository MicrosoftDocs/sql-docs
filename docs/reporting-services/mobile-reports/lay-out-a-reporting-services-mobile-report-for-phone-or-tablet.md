# Lay out a Reporting Services mobile report for phone or tablet
Now that you've [created your Reporting Services mobile report](../../reporting-services/mobile-reports/create-a-reporting-services-mobile-report.md) in [!INCLUDE[SS_MobileReptPub_Short](../../includes/ss-mobilereptpub-long.md)], you can lay out a phone and tablet version of it.  
  
![SSMRP_SalesTrendRptLayout](../../reporting-services/mobile-reports/media/ssmrp-salestrendrptlayout.png)   
*The master layout for the mobile report.*  
  
1. In the upper-right corner of [!INCLUDE[SS_MobileReptPub_Short](../../includes/ss-mobilereptpub-short.md)], select the layout icon > either **Phone** or **Tablet**.  
  
   ![SSMRP_LayoutMenu](../../reporting-services/mobile-reports/media/ssmrp-layoutmenu.png)  
     
   The phone layout grid opens. All the visualizations are on the **Layout** tab.
