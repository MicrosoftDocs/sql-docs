# sys.dm_db_xtp_merge_requests (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2014-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2014-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]


Tracks database merge requests. The merge request may have been generated by SQL Server or the request could have been made by a user with [sys.sp_xtp_merge_checkpoint_files (Transact-SQL)](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sys-sp-xtp-merge-checkpoint-files-transact-sql.md).

> [!NOTE]
> This dynamic management view (DMV), sys.dm_db_xtp_merge_requests, exists until Microsoft SQL Server 2014.
> 
> But starting with SQL Server 2016 this DMV no longer applies.

## Columns in the report

| Column name |	Data type |	Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| request_state | tinyint | Status of the merge request:<br/>0 = requested<br/>1 = pending<br/>2 = installed<br/>3 = abandoned |
| request_state_desc | nvarchar(60) | Meanings for the current state of the request:<br/><br/>Requested - a merge request exists.<br/>Pending - the merge is being processing.<br/>Installed - the merge is complete.<br/>Abandoned - the merge could not complete, perhaps due to lack of storage. |
| destination_file_id | GUID | The unique identifier of the destination file for the merge of the Source files. |
| lower_bound_tsn | bigint | The minimum timestamp for the target merge file. The lowest transaction timestamp of all the source files to be merged. |
| upper_bound_tsn | bigint | The maximum timestamp for the target merge file. The highest transaction timestamp of all the source files to be merged. |
| collection_tsn | bigint | The timestamp at which the current row can be collected.<br/><br/>A row in the Installed state is removed when checkpoint_tsn is greater than collection_tsn.<br/><br/>A row in the Abandoned state is removed when checkpoint_tsn is less than collection_tsn. |
| checkpoint_tsn | bigint | The time that the checkpoint started.<br/><br/>Any deletes done by transactions with a timestamp lower than this are accounted for in the new data file. The remaining deletes are moved to the target delta file. |
| sourcenumber_file_id | GUID | Up to 16 internal file ids that uniquely identify the source files in the merge. |
