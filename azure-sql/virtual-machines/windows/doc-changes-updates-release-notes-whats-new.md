When you deploy an Azure virtual machine (VM) with SQL Server installed on it, either manually, or through a built-in image, you can use Azure features to improve your experience. This article summarizes the documentation changes associated with new features and improvements in the recent releases of [SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines/sql-server/). To learn more about SQL Server on Azure VMs, see the [overview](sql-server-on-azure-vm-iaas-what-is-overview.md). 

For updates made in previous years, see the [What's new archive](doc-changes-updates-release-notes-whats-new-archive.md).
