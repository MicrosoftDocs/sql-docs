# The Oracle CDC Databases
  An Oracle CDC Instance is associated with a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database by the same name on the target [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance. This database is called the Oracle CDC database (or the CDC database).  
  
 The CDC database is created and configured using the Oracle CDC Designer Console and it contains the following elements:  
  
-   A `cdc` schema created by enabling the database for SQL Server CDC.  
  
-   A set of **cdc.xdbcdc_xxxx** tables used by the Oracle CDC Instance.  
  
-   A set of empty mirror tables with the definitions of the captured tables in tuphe Source Oracle database.  
  
-   A set of change tables and change access functions that are generated by the SQL Server CDC mechanism and are identical to those used in the regular, non-Oracle, SQL Server CDC.  
  
 The `cdc` schema is initially accessible only to the members of the **dbowner** fixed database role. Access to the change tables and change functions is determined by the same security model as the SQL Server CDC. For more information about the security model, see [Security Model](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=231151).  
  
## Creating the CDC Database  
 In most cases, the CDC database is created using the CDC Designer Console, but it can also be created with a CDC deployment script that is generated using the CDC Designer Console. The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] system administrator can change the database settings if necessary (for items such as for storage, security, or availability).  
  
 For more information about using the CDC Designer Console to create the database tables and the necessary scripts, see [Use the New Instance Wizard](../../integration-services/change-data-capture/use-the-new-instance-wizard.md).  
  
## CDC Database User Roles  
 When a CDC Database is created and enabled for CDC, a database user called **cdc_service** is created in the CDC database and is associated with the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login that the Oracle CDC Service was configured with. This user is made a member of the **db_datareader**, **db_datawriter**, and **db_ddladmin** database roles. If the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login is also the associated with the `dbo` user then the **cdc_service** is not created.  
  
 This role assignment allows the Oracle CDC Service to update the tables under the `cdc` schema with captured data and with control information.  
  
 When a CDC database is created and CDC source Oracle tables are set up, the CDC database owner can grant SELECT permission of mirror tables and define SQL Server CDC gating roles to control who accesses the change data.  
  
## Mirror Tables  
 For each captured table, \<schema-name>.\<table-name>, in the Oracle source database, a similar empty table is created in the CDC Database, with the same schema and table name. Oracle source tables with the schema name `cdc` (not case sensitive) cannot be captured because the `cdc` schema in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is reserved for the SQL Server CDC.  
  
 The mirror tables are empty; no data is stored in them. They are used to enable the standard SQL Server CDC infrastructure that is used by the Oracle CDC Instance. To prevent data from being inserted or updated into the mirror tables, all UPDATE, DELETE, and INSERT operations are denied for PUBLIC. This ensures that they cannot be modified.  
  
## Access to Change Data  
 Because of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] security model used to gain access to the change data that is associated with a capture instance, the user must be granted `select` access to all the captured columns of the associated mirror table (access permissions to the original Oracle tables do not provide access to the change tables in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]). For information on the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] security model, see [Security Model](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=231151).  
  
 In addition, if a gating role is specified when the capture instance is created, the caller must also be a member of the specified gating role. Other general change data capture functions for accessing metadata are accessible to all database users through the PUBLIC role, although access to the returned metadata is usually gated by using select access to the underlying source tables, and by membership in any defined gating roles.  
  
 Change data may be read by calling special table-based functions generated by the SQL Server CDC component when a capture instance is created. For more information about this function, see [Change Data Capture Functions (Transact-SQL)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=231152).  
  
 Accessing CDC data through the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] CDC Source component is subject to the same rules.  
  
## The CDC Database Tables  
 This section describes the following tables in the CDC database.  
  
-   [Change Tables (_CT)](../../integration-services/change-data-capture/the-oracle-cdc-databases.md#BKMK_Change_Tables_CT)  
  
-   [cdc.lsn_time_mapping](../../integration-services/change-data-capture/the-oracle-cdc-databases.md#BKMK_cdclsn_time_mapping)  
  
-   [cdc.xdbcdc_config](../../integration-services/change-data-capture/the-oracle-cdc-databases.md#BKMK_cdcxdbcdc_config)  
  
-   [cdc.xdbcdc_state](../../integration-services/change-data-capture/the-oracle-cdc-databases.md#BKMK_cdcxdbcdc_state)  
  
-   [cdc.xdbcdc_trace](../../integration-services/change-data-capture/the-oracle-cdc-databases.md#BKMK_cdcxdbcdc_trace)  
  
-   [cdc.xdbcdc_staged_transactions](../../integration-services/change-data-capture/the-oracle-cdc-databases.md#BKMK_cdcxdbcdc_staged_transactions)  
  
###  <a name="BKMK_Change_Tables_CT"></a> Change Tables (_CT)  
 The change tables are created from the mirror tables. They contain the change data that is captured from the Oracle database. The tables are named according to the following convention:  
  
 **[cdc].[\<capture-instance>_CT]**  
  
 When capture is initially enabled for table `<schema-name>.<table-name>`, the default capture instance name is `<schema-name>_<table-name>`. For example, the default capture instance name for the Oracle HR.EMPLOYEES table is HR_EMPLOYEES and the associated change table is [cdc]. [HR_EMPLOYEES_CT].  
  
 The capture tables are written to by the Oracle CDC Instance. They are read using special table-valued functions generated by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] when the capture instance is created. For example, `fn_cdc_get_all_changes_HR_EMPLOYEES`. For more information about these CDC functions see [Change Data Capture Functions (Transact-SQL)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=231152).  
  
###  <a name="BKMK_cdclsn_time_mapping"></a> cdc.lsn_time_mapping  
 The **[cdc].[lsn_time_mapping]** table is generated by the SQL Server CDC component. Its use in the case of Oracle CDC is different than its normal use.  
  
 For the Oracle CDC, the LSN values stored in this table are based on the Oracle System Change Number (SCN) value associated with the change. The first 6 bytes of the LSN value is the original Oracle SCN number.  
  
 Also when using the Oracle CDC, the time columns (`tran_begin_time` and `tran_end_time`) store the UTC time of the change rather than the local time as it does with the regular SQL Server CDC. This ensures that daylight savings time changes do not impact the data stored in the lsn_time_mapping.  
  
###  <a name="BKMK_cdcxdbcdc_config"></a> cdc.xdbcdc_config  
 This table contains the configuration data for the Oracle CDC Instance. It is updated using the CDC Designer Console. This table has only one row.  
  
 The following table describes the **cdc.xdbcdc_config** table columns.

|connect_string|An Oracle connection string. A basic example is:<br /><br /> `<server>:<port>/<instance>` (for example, `erp.contoso.com:1521/orcl`).<br /><br /> The connection string can also specify an Oracle Net connect descriptor, for example, `(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=tcp) (HOST=erp.contoso.com) (PORT=1521)) (CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=orcl)))`.<br /><br /> If using a directory server or tnsnames, the connect string can be the name of the connection.<br /><br /> For more information about Oracle connection strings, see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=231153](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=231153) for detailed information on Oracle database connection strings for the Oracle Instant Client that is used by the Oracle CDC Service.|  
|use_windows_authentication|A Boolean value that can be:<br /><br /> **0**: An Oracle user name and password are provided for authentication (the default)<br /><br /> **1**: Windows authentication is used to connect to the Oracle database.

###  <a name="BKMK_cdcxdbcdc_state"></a> cdc.xdbcdc_state  
 This table contains information about the persisted state of the Oracle CDC Instance. The capture state is used in recovery and fail-over scenarios and for health monitoring.  
  
 The following table describes the **cdc.xdbcdc_state** table columns.  
  
|Item|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|status|The current status code for the current Oracle CDC Instance. The status describes the current state for the CDC.|  
|sub_status|A second level status that provides additional information about the current status.|  
|active|A Boolean value that can be:<br /><br /> **0**: The Oracle CDC Instance process is not active.<br /><br /> **1**: The Oracle CDC Instance process is active.|  
|error|A Boolean value that can be:<br /><br /> **0**: The Oracle CDC Instance process is not in an error state.<br /><br /> **1**: The Oracle CDC Instance is in an error state.|  
|status_message|A string that provides a description of the error or status.|  
|timestamp|The timestamp with the time (UTC) that the capture state was last updated.|  
|active_capture_node|The name of the host (the host can be a node on a cluster) that is currently running the Oracle CDC Service and the Oracle CDC Instance (which is processing the Oracle transaction logs).|  
|last_transaction_timestamp|A timestamp with the time (UTC) when the last transaction that was written to the change tables.|  
|last_change_timestamp|A timestamp with the time (UTC) when the most recent change record was read from the source Oracle transaction log. This timestamp helps to identify the current latency of the CDC process.|  
|transaction_log_head_cn|The most recent change number (CN) read from the Oracle transaction log.|  
|transaction_log_tail_cn|The change number (CN) on the Oracle transaction log where the Oracle CDC Instance repositions to in case of a restart or recovery.|  
|current_cn|The most recent change number (CN) known to be in the source database.|  
|software_version|The internal version of the Oracle CDC Service.|  
|completed_transactions|The number of transactions processed since the CDC was last reset.|

|staged_transactions|The number of currently active transactions that are staged in the **cdc.xdbcdc_staged_transactions** table.|  
  
###  <a name="BKMK_cdcxdbcdc_trace"></a> cdc.xdbcdc_trace  
 This table contains information about the operation of the CDC instance. Information stored in this table includes error records, notable status changes, and trace records. Error information is also written to the Windows event log to ensure that the information is available if the **cdc.xcbcdc_trace** table is unavailable.  
  
 The following table describes the cdc.xdbcdc_trace table columns.  
  
|Item|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|timestamp|The exact UTC timestamp when the trace record was written.|  
|type|Contains one of the following values.<br /><br /> ERROR<br /><br /> INFO<br /><br /> TRACE|  
|node|The name of the node on which the record was written.|  
|status|The status code that is used by the state table.|  
|sub_status|The sub-status code that is used by the state table.|  
|status_message|The status message that is used by the state table.|  
|data|Additional data for cases when the error or trace record contains a payload (for example, a corrupted log record).|  
  
###  <a name="BKMK_cdcxdbcdc_staged_transactions"></a> cdc.xdbcdc_staged_transactions  
 This table stores change records for large or long-running transactions until the transaction commit or rollback event is captured. The Oracle CDC Service orders captured log records by transaction commit time and then by chronological order for each transaction. Log records for the same transaction are stored in memory until the transaction ends and then are written to the target change table or discarded (in case of a rollback). Because there is a limited amount of memory available, large transactions are written into the **cdc.xdbcdc_staged_transactions** table until the transaction is complete. Transactions are also written to the staging table when they run for a long time. Therefore, when the Oracle CDC Instance is restarted, the old changes do not need to be re-read from the Oracle transaction logs.  
  
 The following table describes the **cdc.xdbcdc_staged_transactions** table columns.  
  
|Item|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|transaction_id|The unique transaction identifier of the transaction being staged.|  
|seq_num|The number of **xcbcdc_staged_transactions** row for the current transaction (starting with 0).|  
|data_start_cn|The change number (CN) for the first change in the data in this row.|  
|data_end_cn|The change number (CN) for the last change in the data in this row.|  
|data|The staged changes for the transaction in the form of a BLOB.|
