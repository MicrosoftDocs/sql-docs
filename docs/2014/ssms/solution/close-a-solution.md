# Close a Solution
  You can close a solution and remove it from Solution Explorer. Closing a solution makes it unavailable for use by Solution Explorer.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Closing Solution Explorer does not automatically close the solution. It only hides the Solution Explorer window.  
  
### To close a solution  
  
1.  On the **File** menu, click **Close Solution**.
