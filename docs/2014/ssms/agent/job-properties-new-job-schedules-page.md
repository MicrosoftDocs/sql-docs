# Job Properties: New Job (Schedules Page)
  Use this page to view and organize schedules for a [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent job.  
  
## Options  
 **Schedule list**  
 Lists the schedules for this job.  
  
 **New**  
 Create a new schedule. After you create the schedule, the schedule is added to the job.  
  
 **Pick**  
 Select a schedule from the existing schedules. Because a job and schedule must have the same owner, this option will only allow you to pick from schedules that you own.  
  
 **Edit**  
 Edit the selected schedule to change job schedule properties.  
  
 **Remove**  
 Remove the selected schedule from the job. If no other jobs use the schedule, the schedule is deleted from the database.
