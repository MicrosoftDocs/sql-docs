# Create, Delete, or Modify a Folder (web portal)
  You can create folders to organize and manage the items you publish to a report server. Creating folders can help users find reports of interest to them. For content managers, folders provide a framework for applying permissions. You can create role assignments on specific folders to restrict access to reports that are in development or that should not be widely distributed.  
  
#### To create a folder  
  
1.  Start the [Report Manager  &#40;SSRS Native Mode&#41;](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/80949f9d-58f5-48e3-9342-9e9bf4e57896).  
  
2.  In the web portal, select **Folder** under the **New** menu drop down. Or, to create a folder under an existing folder, navigate to that folder and select **Folder** under the **New** menu drop down.  
  
     The **Create a new folder in** dialog opens.  
  
3.  Type a folder name. A folder name can include spaces, but cannot include reserved characters that are used for URL encoding: \; \? \: \@ \& \= \+ \, \$ \/ \* \< \> \|. You cannot type a series of folder names to create several folders at once.  
  
4.  Select **Create**.  
  
#### To modify or delete a folder  
  
1.  In the web portal, navigate to the **Home** page, and locate the item that you want to modify.  
  
2.  Select the **...** for the desired folder.  
  
3.  In the context menu, select **Manage**. The Properties page opens.  
  
4.  Modify folder properties in the following ways:  
  
    -   To modify display text about the folder, type a name or description.  
  
    -   To display the folder in the default view on the **Home** page, clear **Hide in tile view**.  
  
5.  Or, to remove the folder and its contents, click **Delete**.  
  
6.  Click **Apply** to save changes.
