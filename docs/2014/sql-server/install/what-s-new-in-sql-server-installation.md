# What&#39;s New in SQL Server Installation
  Windows Vista is not a supported operating system for [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)]. Service Pack 1 remains as the minimum requirement for [!INCLUDE[win7](../../includes/win7-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[winserver2008r2](../../includes/winserver2008r2-md.md)] operating systems. For more information on operating system requirements, see [Hardware and Software Requirements for Installing SQL Server 2014](hardware-and-software-requirements-for-installing-sql-server.md).  
  
 Installation of [!INCLUDE[ssExpCurrent](../../includes/ssexpcurrent-md.md)] will prompt you to specify the directory to save the extracted package. If no location is entered, [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)] will default to the computer's system drive. The extracted files will remain after [!INCLUDE[ssExpCurrent](../../includes/ssexpcurrent-md.md)] installation is complete.  
  
 In [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)], SysPrep is supported for all installations of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. SysPrep now supports failover cluster installations. For more information, see [Considerations for Installing SQL Server Using SysPrep](../../database-engine/install-windows/considerations-for-installing-sql-server-using-sysprep.md) and [Install SQL Server 2014 Using SysPrep](../../database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server-using-sysprep.md).  
  
 Upgrade from [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../includes/ssversion2005-md.md)] is supported, but side-by-side is not supported. For more information about [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../includes/ssversion2005-md.md)] support in [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)], see [Supported Version and Edition Upgrades](../../database-engine/install-windows/supported-version-and-edition-upgrades.md).  
  
 Beginning in [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)], the database engine in the Standard edition has a memory capacity of 128 GB. In [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)], the database engine in the Standard edition had a memory capacity of 64 GB.
