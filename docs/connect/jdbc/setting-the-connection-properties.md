# Setting the connection properties

[!INCLUDE[Driver_JDBC_Download](../../includes/driver_jdbc_download.md)]

The connection string properties can be specified in various ways:

- As name=value properties in the connection URL when you connect by using the DriverManager class. For connection string syntax, see [Building the connection URL](building-the-connection-url.md).
- As name=value properties in the *Properties* parameter of the [Connect method in the DriverManager class](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.microsoft.sqlserver/mssql-jdbc/latest/com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc/com/microsoft/sqlserver/jdbc/SQLServerDriver.html#connect(java.lang.String,java.util.Properties)).
- As values in the appropriate setter method of the [data source of the driver](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.microsoft.sqlserver/mssql-jdbc/latest/com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc/com/microsoft/sqlserver/jdbc/ISQLServerDataSource.html). For example:

    ```java
    datasource.setServerName(value)
    datasource.setDatabaseName(value)
    ```

## Remarks

Property names are case-insensitive, and duplicate property names are resolved in the following order:

1. API arguments (such as user and password)
2. Property collection
3. Last instance in the connection string
   
Unknown values are allowed for the property names, and aren't validated by the JDBC driver for case sensitivity.

Synonyms are allowed and are resolved in order, just as duplicate property names.

## Properties

The following table lists all the currently available connection string properties for the JDBC driver.

| Property<br/>Type<br/>Default | Description |
| :------------------------------ | :---------- |
| accessToken<br/><br/>String<br/><br/>null | (Version 6.0+) Use this property to connect to a database using an access token. **accessToken** can't be set using the connection URL. |
| applicationIntent<br/><br/>String<br/><br/>ReadWrite | (Version 6.0+) Declares the application workload type to connect to a server. <br/><br/>Possible values are **ReadOnly** and **ReadWrite**. <br/><br/>For more information about disaster recovery, see [JDBC driver support for High Availability, disaster recovery](jdbc-driver-support-for-high-availability-disaster-recovery.md). |
| applicationName<br/><br/>String<br/>[&lt;=128 char]<br/><br/>null | The application name, or "Microsoft JDBC Driver for SQL Server" if no name is provided.<br/><br/>Used to identify the specific application in various [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] profiling and logging tools. |
| authentication<br/><br/>String<br/><br/>NotSpecified | (Version 6.0+) This optional property indicates which authentication method to use for connection. Possible values are **ActiveDirectoryIntegrated**, **ActiveDirectoryPassword**, **ActiveDirectoryMSI** (version 7.2+), **ActiveDirectoryInteractive** (version 9.2+), **ActiveDirectoryServicePrincipal** (version 9.2+), **SqlPassword**, and the default **NotSpecified**.<br/><br/> Use **ActiveDirectoryIntegrated** (version 6.0+) to connect to an SQL database using integrated Windows authentication.<br/><br/> Use **ActiveDirectoryPassword** (version 6.0+) to connect to an SQL database using an Azure AD principal name and password.<br/><br/> Use **ActiveDirectoryMSI** (version 7.2+) to connect to an SQL database from inside an Azure Resource. For example, an Azure Virtual Machine, App Service or Function App using Managed Identity (MSI) authentication. <br><br>The two types of Managed Identities supported by the driver when using **ActiveDirectoryMSI** authentication mode are: <br> 1. _System-Assigned Managed Identity_: Used to acquire **accessToken** by default. <br> 2. _User-Assigned Managed Identity_: Used to acquire **accessToken** if the Client ID of a Managed Identity (MSI) is specified with the **msiClientId** connection property.<br/><br/>Use **ActiveDirectoryInteractive** to connect to an SQL database using an interactive authentication flow. <br/><br/>Use **ActiveDirectoryServicePrincipal** (version 9.2+) to connect to an SQL database using the client ID and secret of a service principal identity. Specify client ID in the userName property and secret in the password property (10.2+).<br/><br/> Use **SqlPassword** to connect to an SQL database using **userName**/**user** and **password** properties.<br/><br/> Use **NotSpecified** if none of these authentication methods are needed.<br/><br/> **Important:**  If authentication is set to ActiveDirectoryIntegrated, the following two libraries must be installed: **mssql-jdbc_auth-\<version>-\<arch>.dll** (available in the JDBC driver package) and Microsoft Authentication Library for SQL Server (**ADAL.DLL**). Microsoft Authentication Library can be installed from [Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server](../odbc/download-odbc-driver-for-sql-server.md) or [Microsoft OLE DB Driver for SQL Server](../oledb/download-oledb-driver-for-sql-server.md). The JDBC driver only supports version **1.0.2028.318 and higher** for ADAL.DLL.<br/><br/> **Note:**  When the authentication property is set to any value other than **NotSpecified**, the driver by default uses Transport Layer Security (TLS), previously known as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), encryption.<br/><br/> For information on how to configure Azure Active Directory authentication, see [Connecting to SQL Database By Using Azure Active Directory Authentication](/azure/azure-sql/database/authentication-aad-overview). |
| authenticationScheme<br/><br/>String<br/><br/>NativeAuthentication | Indicates which kind of integrated security you want your application to use. Possible values are **JavaKerberos**, **NTLM** (version 7.4+), and the default **NativeAuthentication**.<br/><br/> **NativeAuthentication** causes the driver to load `mssql-jdbc_auth-<version>-<arch>.dll` (for example, `mssql-jdbc_auth-8.2.2.x64.dll`) on Windows, which is used to obtain integrated authentication information. <br/><br/>  (The native authentication library loaded is named `sqljdbc_auth.dll` when using driver versions 6.0 through 7.4.) <br/><br/> When using **authenticationScheme=JavaKerberos**, you must specify the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) in the **serverName** or **serverSpn** property. Otherwise, an error occurs (Server not found in Kerberos database).<br/><br/> For more information about using **authenticationScheme=JavaKerberos**, see [Using Kerberos integrated authentication to connect to SQL Server](using-kerberos-integrated-authentication-to-connect-to-sql-server.md). <br/><br/> When using **authenticationScheme=NTLM**, you must specify the Windows domain by using the **domain** or **domainName** property, the Windows credentials in the **user** or **userName** property, and the **password** property. Otherwise, an error occurs (connection properties must be specified). |
| cancelQueryTimeout<br/><br/>int<br/><br/>-1 | (Version 6.4+) This property can be used to cancel a **queryTimeout** set on the connection. Query execution hangs and doesn't throw an exception if the TCP connection to the server is silently dropped. This property is only applicable if 'queryTimeout' is also set on the connection. <br/><br/>The driver waits the total amount of **cancelQueryTimeout** + **queryTimeout** seconds, to drop the connection and close the channel. <br/><br/>The default value for this property is -1 and behavior is to wait indefinitely. |
| clientCertificate<br/><br/>String<br/><br/>null | (Version 8.4+) Specifies the location of the certificate to be used for client certificate authentication. The JDBC driver supports PFX, PEM, DER, and CER file extensions. <br/><br/>For details, see [Client Certificate Authentication for Loopback Scenarios](client-certification-authentication-for-loopback-scenarios.md). |
| clientKey <br/><br/>String<br/><br/>null | (Version 8.4+) Specifies the location of the private key for PEM, DER, and CER certificates specified by the clientCertificate attribute. <br/><br/>For details, see [Client Certificate Authentication for Loopback Scenarios](client-certification-authentication-for-loopback-scenarios.md). |
| clientKeyPassword <br/><br/>String<br/><br/>null | (Version 8.4+) Specifies the optional password string for accessing the clientKey file's private key. <br/><br/>For details, see [Client Certificate Authentication for Loopback Scenarios](client-certification-authentication-for-loopback-scenarios.md). |
| columnEncryptionSetting<br/><br/>String<br/>["Enabled" &#124; "Disabled"]<br/><br/>Disabled | (Version 6.0+) Set to "Enabled" to use the Always Encrypted (AE) feature. When AE is enabled, the JDBC driver transparently encrypts and decrypts sensitive data stored in encrypted database columns on the server.<br/><br/> For more information about Always Encrypted, see [Using Always Encrypted with the JDBC driver](using-always-encrypted-with-the-jdbc-driver.md).<br/><br/> **Note:**  Always Encrypted is available with SQL Server 2016 or later and Azure SQL Database. |
| connectRetryCount<br/><br/>int<br/>[0..255]<br/><br/>1 | (Version 9.4+) The number of reconnection attempts if there's a connection failure. |
| connectRetryInterval<br/><br/>int<br/>[1..60]<br/><br/>10 | (Version 9.4+) The number of seconds between each connection retry attempt. |
| databaseName,<br/>database<br/><br/>String<br/>[&lt;=128 char]<br/><br/>null | The name of the database to connect to. <br/><br/>If not stated, a connection is made to the default database. |
| delayLoadingLobs<br/><br/>boolean<br/>["true" &#124; "false"]<br/><br/>true | Flag to indicate whether to stream or not stream all the LOB objects being retrieved from the ResultSet. Setting this property to "false" loads the entire LOB object into memory without streaming. |
| domainName,<br/>domain<br/><br/>String<br/>null | (Version 7.4+) The Windows domain to authenticate to when using NTLM authentication. |
| disableStatementPooling<br/><br/>boolean<br/>["true" &#124; "false"]<br/><br/>true | Flag indicates if statement pooling should be used. |
| enablePrepareOnFirst...<br/>PreparedStatementCall<br/><br/>boolean<br/>["true" &#124; "false"]<br/><br/>false | Set to "true" to enable prepared statement handle creation by calling <code>sp_prepexec</code> with the first execution of a prepared statement. <br/><br/>Set to "false" to change the first execution of a prepared statement to call <code>sp_executesql</code> and not prepare a statement. If a second execution happens, it calls <code>sp_prepexec</code> to set up a prepared statement handle. |
| enclaveAttestationUrl<br/><br/>String<br/><br/>null | (Version 8.2+) This optional property indicates the attestation service endpoint URL to use for Always Encrypted with secure enclaves.<br/><br/>For more information about Always Encrypted with secure enclaves, see [Always Encrypted with secure enclaves](using-always-encrypted-with-secure-enclaves-with-the-jdbc-driver.md). |
| enclaveAttestationProtocol<br/><br/>String<br/><br/>null | (Version 8.2+) This optional property indicates the attestation protocol to use for Always Encrypted with secure enclaves. Currently, the only supported values for this field are **HGS**, **AAS**, and **NONE** (**NONE** is only supported in version 11.2+). <br/><br/>For more information about Always Encrypted with secure enclaves, see [Always Encrypted with secure enclaves](using-always-encrypted-with-secure-enclaves-with-the-jdbc-driver.md). |
| encrypt<br/><br/>String<br/><br/>null | Set to "true" to specify that the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] uses TLS encryption for all the data sent between the client and the server if the server has a certificate installed. The default value is "true" in version 10.2 and up and "false" in 9.4 and below.<br/><br/> In version 6.0 and up, there is a new connection setting 'authentication' that uses TLS encryption by default. <br/><br/>For more information about this property, see the 'authentication' property.<br/><br/> In version 11.2.0 and up, **encrypt** has been changed from **boolean** to **string**, allowing for TDS 8.0 support when the property is set to **strict**.  |
| failoverPartner<br/><br/>String<br/><br/>null | The name of the failover server used in a database mirroring configuration. This property is used for an initial connection failure to the principal server. After you make the initial connection, this property is ignored. Must be used with the databaseName property.<br/><br/> **Note:** The driver doesn't support the server instance port number for the failover partner instance as part of the failoverPartner property in the connection string. However, specifying the serverName, instanceName, and portNumber properties of the principal server instance and failoverPartner property of the failover partner instance in the same connection string is supported.<br/><br/> If you specify a Virtual Network Name in the **Server** connection property, you can't use database mirroring. For more information about disaster recovery, see [JDBC driver support for High Availability, disaster recovery](jdbc-driver-support-for-high-availability-disaster-recovery.md) |
| `fips`<br/><br/>boolean<br/>["true" &#124; "false"]<br/><br/>"false" | For FIPS enabled Java Virtual Machine (JVM) this property should be **true**. |
| fipsProvider<br/><br/>String<br/><br/>null | FIPS provider configured in JVM. For example, BCFIPS or SunPKCS11-NSS. Removed in version 6.4.0 -- see the details [Here](https://github.com/Microsoft/mssql-jdbc/pull/460). |
| gsscredential<br/><br/>org.ietf.jgss.GSSCredential<br/><br/>null | (Version 6.2+) User credentials to be used for Kerberos Constrained Delegation can be passed in this property. <br/><br/>This should be used with **integratedSecurity** as **true** and **JavaKerberos** as **authenticationScheme**. |
| hostNameInCertificate<br/><br/>String<br/><br/>null | The host name to be used to validate the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] TLS/SSL certificate.<br/><br/> If the hostNameInCertificate property is unspecified or set to null, the [!INCLUDE[jdbcNoVersion](../../includes/jdbcnoversion_md.md)] uses the **serverName** property value on the connection URL as the host name to validate the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] TLS/SSL certificate.<br/><br/> **Note:**  This property is used in combination with the **encrypt**/**authentication** properties and the **trustServerCertificate** property. This property affects the certificate validation, if the connection uses TLS encryption and the **trustServerCertificate** is set to "false". Make sure the value passed to **hostNameInCertificate** matches the Common Name (CN) or DNS name in the Subject Alternate Name (SAN) in the server certificate for a TLS connection to succeed. For more information about encryption support, see [Understanding encryption support](understanding-ssl-support.md). |
| instanceName<br/><br/>String<br/>[&lt;=128 char]<br/><br/>null | The database instance name to connect to. When it isn't specified, a connection is made to the default instance. For the case where both the instanceName and port are specified, see the notes for port.<br/><br/> If you specify a Virtual Network Name in the **Server** connection property, you can't use the **instanceName** connection property. For more information about disaster recovery, see [JDBC Driver Support for High Availability, Disaster Recovery](jdbc-driver-support-for-high-availability-disaster-recovery.md). |
| integratedSecurity<br/><br/>boolean<br/>["true"&#124;"false"]<br/><br/>false | Set to "true" to indicate that Windows credentials are used by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on Windows operating systems. If "true", the JDBC driver searches the local computer credential cache for credentials that were provided when a user signed in to the computer or network.<br/><br/> Set to "true" (with **authenticationscheme=JavaKerberos**), to indicate that Kerberos credentials are used by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. For more information about Kerberos authentication, see [Using Kerberos integrated authentication to connect to SQL Server](using-kerberos-integrated-authentication-to-connect-to-sql-server.md). <br/><br/> Set to "true" (with **authenticationscheme=NTLM**), to indicate that NTLM credentials are used by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. <br/><br/> If "false", the username and password must be supplied. |
| ipaddresspreference<br/><br/>String<br/>[&lt;=128 char]<br/><br/>IPv4First | The IP preference used by the client application.<br/><br/> With **IPV4First**, the driver will traverse IPv4 addresses first. If no IPv4 addresses can be connected to successfully, the driver continues and tries IPv6 addresses, if there are any.<br/><br/> With **IPV6First**, the driver will traverse IPv6 addresses first. If no IPv6 addresses can be connected to successfully, the driver continues and tries IPv4 addresses, if there are any.<br/><br/> With **UsePlatformDefault**, the driver will traverse all IP addresses in their initial orders from DNS resolution. |
| jaasConfigurationName<br/><br/>String<br/><br/>SQLJDBCDriver | (Version 6.2+) Each connection to SQL Server can have its own JAAS Login Configuration file to establish a Kerberos connection. The name of the JAAS Login Configuration file can be passed through this property. <br/> By default, the driver sets `useDefaultCcache = true` for IBM JVMs, and `useTicketCache = true` for other JVMs. |
| keyStoreAuthentication<br/><br/>String<br/><br/>null | (Version 6.0+) This property identifies which key store to use with Always Encrypted and determines an authentication mechanism used to authenticate to the key store. The driver supports setting up of the Java Key Store seamlessly when you set "**keyStoreAuthentication=JavaKeyStorePassword**". To use this property, you also must set the **keyStoreLocation** and **keyStoreSecret** properties for the Java Key Store. <br/><br/>For more information about Always Encrypted, see [Using Always Encrypted with the JDBC driver](using-always-encrypted-with-the-jdbc-driver.md). <br/><br/> Beginning with Microsoft JDBC Driver 8.4, you can set "**keyStoreAuthentication=KeyVaultManagedIdentity**" or "**keyStoreAuthentication=KeyVaultClientSecret**" to authenticate to Azure Key Vault using Managed Identities. <br/><br/> For more information about Always Encrypted, see [Using Always Encrypted with the JDBC driver](using-always-encrypted-with-the-jdbc-driver.md). |
| keyStoreLocation<br/><br/>String<br/><br/>null | (Version 6.0+) When **keyStoreAuthentication=JavaKeyStorePassword**, the **keyStoreLocation** property identifies the path to the Java keystore file that stores the Column Master Key to be used with Always Encrypted data. The path must include the keystore filename.<br/><br/>For more information about Always Encrypted, see [Using Always Encrypted with the JDBC driver](using-always-encrypted-with-the-jdbc-driver.md). |
| keyStorePrincipalId<br/><br/>String<br/><br/>null | (Version 8.4+) When **keyStoreAuthentication=KeyVaultManagedIdentity**, the **keyStorePrincipalId** property specifies a valid Azure Active Directory application client ID.  <br/><br/>For more information about Always Encrypted, see [Using Always Encrypted with the JDBC driver](using-always-encrypted-with-the-jdbc-driver.md). |
| keyStoreSecret<br/><br/>String<br/><br/>null | (Version 6.0+) When **keyStoreAuthentication=JavaKeyStorePassword**, the **keyStoreSecret** property identifies the password to use for the keystore and the key. For using the Java Key Store, the keystore and the key password must be the same.<br/><br/>For more information about Always Encrypted, see [Using Always Encrypted with the JDBC driver](using-always-encrypted-with-the-jdbc-driver.md). |
| lastUpdateCount<br/><br/>boolean<br/>["true" &#124; "false"]<br/><br/>true | A "true" value only returns the last update count from an SQL statement passed to the server, and it can be used on single SELECT, INSERT, or DELETE statements to ignore other update count caused by server triggers. Setting this property to "false" causes all update counts to be returned, including this update counts returned by server triggers.<br/><br/> **Note:**  This property only applies when it's used with the [executeUpdate](reference/executeupdate-method-sqlserverstatement.md) methods. All other execute methods return all results and update counts. This property only affects update counts returned by server triggers. It doesn't affect result sets or errors that result as part of trigger execution. |
| lockTimeout<br/><br/>int<br/><br/>-1 | The number of milliseconds to wait before the database reports a lock time-out. The default behavior is to wait indefinitely. If it's specified, this value is the default for all statements on the connection. **Statement.setQueryTimeout()** can be used to set the time-out for specific statements. The value can be 0, which specifies no wait. |
| loginTimeout<br/><br/>int<br/>[0..65535]<br/><br/>15 | The number of seconds the driver should wait before timing out a failed connection. A zero value indicates that the timeout is the default system timeout, which is specified as 15 seconds by default. A non-zero value is the number of seconds the driver should wait before timing out a failed connection.<br/><br/> If you specify a Virtual Network Name in the **Server** connection property, you should specify a timeout value of three minutes or more to allow sufficient time for a failover connection to succeed. For more information about disaster recovery, see [JDBC driver support for High Availability, disaster recovery](jdbc-driver-support-for-high-availability-disaster-recovery.md). |
| maxResultBuffer<br/><br/>String<br/><br/>null | (Version 9.2+) **maxResultBuffer** can be used to set the maximum bytes to read when reading a result set. If not specified, then the entire result set is read. Size can be specified in two styles:<br>1. as size of bytes (for example, 100, 150M, 300K, 400G)<br>2. as a percent of maximum heap memory (for example, 10p, 15pct, 20percent).|
| msiClientId<br/><br/>String<br/><br/>null | (Version 7.2+) The Client ID of the Managed Identity (MSI) used to acquire an **accessToken** to establish a connection with the **ActiveDirectoryMSI** authentication mode.|
| multiSubnetFailover<br/><br/>Boolean<br/><br/>false | Always specify **multiSubnetFailover=true** to connect to the availability group listener of a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] availability group or an [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Failover Cluster Instance. **multiSubnetFailover=true** configures the driver to provide faster detection of and connection to the (currently) active server. Possible values are true and false. For more information about disaster recovery, see [JDBC Driver Support for High Availability, Disaster Recovery](jdbc-driver-support-for-high-availability-disaster-recovery.md).<br/><br/> You can programmatically access the **multiSubnetFailover** connection property with [getPropertyInfo](reference/getpropertyinfo-method-sqlserverdriver.md), [getMultiSubnetFailover](reference/getmultisubnetfailover-method-sqlserverdatasource.md), and [setMultiSubnetFailover](reference/setmultisubnetfailover-method-sqlserverdatasource.md).<br/><br/> **Note:**  Beginning with Microsoft JDBC Driver 6.0 for SQL Server, it's no longer required to set **multiSubnetFailover** to "true" to connect to an availability group listener. A new property, **transparentNetworkIPResolution**, which is enabled by default, provides the detection of and connection to the (currently) active server. |
| packetSize<br/><br/>int<br/>[-1 &#124; 0 &#124; 512..32767]<br/><br/>8000 | The network packet size used to communicate with the server, specified in bytes. A value of -1 indicates to use the server's default packet size. A value of 0 indicates to use the maximum value of 32767. If this property is set to a value outside the acceptable range, an exception occurs.<br/><br/> **Important:**  Using the packetSize property when the encryption is enabled (encrypt=true) is not recommended. Otherwise, the driver might raise a connection error. For more information about this property, see the [setPacketSize](reference/setpacketsize-method-sqlserverdatasource.md) method of the [SQLServerDataSource](reference/sqlserverdatasource-class.md) class. |
| password<br/><br/>String<br/>[&lt;=128 char]<br/><br/>null | The database password, if connection with SQL user and password.<br/>For Kerberos connection with principal name and password, this property is set to the Kerberos Principal password. <br/><br/>(Version 10.2+) When **authentication=ActiveDirectoryServicePrincipal**, the **password** property identifies the password to use for the Active Directory principal.|
| portNumber,<br/>port<br/><br/>int<br/>[0..65535]<br/><br/>1433 | The port where the server is listening. If the port number is specified in the connection string, no request to SQLbrowser is made. When the port and instanceName are both specified, the connection is made to the specified port. However, the **instanceName** is validated and an error is thrown if it doesn't match the port.<br/><br/> **Important:** It is recommended that the port number is always specified, as it's more secure than using SQLbrowser. |
| prepareMethod<br/><br/>String<br/><br/>prepexec | (Version 11.2.0+) Specifies the underlying prepare method to be used by the driver with prepared statements.<br/><br/> Set to **prepare** to use `sp_prepare` as the prepare method. This results in a separate, initial trip to the database to prepare the statement without any initial values for the database to consider in the execution plan. Set to **prepexec** to use `sp_prepexec` as the prepare method. This method combines the prepare action with the first execute, reducing round trips. It also provides the database with initial parameter values that the database may consider in the execution plan. |
| queryTimeout<br/><br/>int<br/><br/>-1 | The number of seconds to wait before a timeout has occurred on a query. The default value is -1, which means infinite timeout. Set this value to 0 also implies to wait indefinitely. |
| realm<br/><br/>String<br/><br/>null | (Version 9.4+) The realm for Kerberos authentication. Set this value to override the Kerberos authentication realm the driver autodetects from the server's realm. |
| replication<br/><br/>boolean<br/>["true" &#124; "false"]<br/><br/>false | (Version 9.4+) This setting tells the server if the connection is used for replication. When enabled, triggers with the `NOT FOR REPLICATION` option won't fire on the connection. |
| responseBuffering<br/><br/>String<br/>["full" &#124; "adaptive"]<br/><br/>adaptive | If this property is set to "adaptive", the minimum possible data is buffered when necessary. The default mode is "adaptive."<br/><br/> If this property is set to "full", the entire result set is read from the server when a statement is executed.<br/><br/> **Note:** After upgrading the JDBC driver from version 1.2, the default buffering behavior will be "adaptive." If you want to keep the version 1.2 default behavior in your application, you must set the responseBufferring property to "full" either in the connection properties, or use the [setResponseBuffering](reference/setresponsebuffering-method-sqlserverstatement.md) method of the [SQLServerStatement](reference/sqlserverstatement-class.md) object. |
| selectMethod<br/><br/>String<br/>["direct" &#124; "cursor"]<br/><br/>direct | If this property is set to "cursor," a database cursor is created for each query created on the connection for **TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY** and **CONCUR_READ_ONLY** cursors. This property is typically required only if the application generates large result sets that can't be fully contained in client memory. If this property is set to "cursor," only a limited number of result set rows are kept in client memory. <br/><br/>The default behavior is that all result set rows are kept in client memory. This behavior provides the fastest performance when the application is processing all rows. |
| sendStringParameters...<br/>AsUnicode<br/><br/>boolean<br/>["true" &#124; "false"]<br/><br/>true | If the **sendStringParametersAsUnicode** property is set to "true", String parameters are sent to the server in Unicode format.<br/><br/> If the **sendStringParametersAsUnicode** property is set to "false", String parameters are sent to the server in non-Unicode format such as ASCII/MBCS instead of Unicode.<br/><br/> The default value for the **sendStringParametersAsUnicode** property is "true".<br/><br/> **Note:** The **sendStringParametersAsUnicode** property is only checked to send a parameter value with **CHAR**, **VARCHAR**, or **LONGVARCHAR** JDBC types. The new JDBC 4.0 national character methods, such as the setNString, setNCharacterStream, and setNClob methods of [SQLServerPreparedStatement](reference/sqlserverpreparedstatement-class.md) and [SQLServerCallableStatement](reference/sqlservercallablestatement-class.md) classes, always send their parameter values to the server in Unicode whatever the setting of this property.<br/><br/> For optimal performance with the **CHAR**, **VARCHAR**, and **LONGVARCHAR** JDBC data types, an application should set the **sendStringParametersAsUnicode** property to "false" and use the setString, setCharacterStream, and setClob non-national character methods of the [SQLServerPreparedStatement](reference/sqlserverpreparedstatement-class.md) and [SQLServerCallableStatement](reference/sqlservercallablestatement-class.md) classes.<br/><br/> When the application sets the **sendStringParametersAsUnicode** property to "false" and uses a non-national character method to access Unicode data types on the server side (such as **nchar**, **nvarchar** and **ntext**), some data might be lost if the database collation doesn't support the characters in the String parameters passed by the non-national character method.<br/><br/> An application should use the setNString, setNCharacterStream, and setNClob national character methods of the [SQLServerPreparedStatement](reference/sqlserverpreparedstatement-class.md) and [SQLServerCallableStatement](reference/sqlservercallablestatement-class.md) classes for the **NCHAR**, **NVARCHAR**, and **LONGNVARCHAR** JDBC data types. |
| sendTemporalDataTypesAsStringForBulkCopy<br/><br/>boolean<br/>["true" &#124; "false"]<br/><br/>true | (Version 8.4+) This connection property, when set to "false", sends **DATE**, **DATETIME**, **DATIMETIME2**, **DATETIMEOFFSET**, **SMALLDATETIME**, and **TIME** datatypes as their respective types instead of sending them as String.<br/><br/>With this connection property set to "false", the driver will only accept the default string literal format of each temporal datatype, for example:<br/><br/>DATE: `YYYY-MM-DD`<br/>DATETIME: `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss[.nnn]`<br/>DATETIME2: `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss[.nnnnnnn]`<br/>DATETIMEOFFSET: `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss[.nnnnnnn] [{+/-}hh:mm]`<br/>SMALLDATETIME: `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss`<br/>TIME: `hh:mm:ss[.nnnnnnn]`<br/> |
| sendTimeAsDatetime<br/><br/>boolean<br/>["true" &#124; "false"]<br/><br/>true | This property was added in SQL Server JDBC Driver 3.0.<br/><br/> Set to "true" to send java.sql.Time values to the server as [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] **datetime** values. <br/>Set to "false" to send java.sql.Time values to the server as [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] **time** values.<br/><br/> The default value for this property is currently "true" and might change in a future release.<br/><br/> For more information about how the [!INCLUDE[jdbcNoVersion](../../includes/jdbcnoversion_md.md)] configures java.sql.Time values before it sends them to the server, see [Configuring How java.sql.Time Values are Sent to the Server](configuring-how-java-sql-time-values-are-sent-to-the-server.md). |
| serverCertificate,<br/>server<br/><br/>String<br/><br/>null | (Version 11.2.0+) The path to the server certificate file. Used for validation when using **encrypt** set to **strict**. The driver supports certificate files using the PEM file format. |
| serverName,<br/>server<br/><br/>String<br/><br/>null | The computer running [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or an Azure SQL database.<br/><br/> You can also specify the Virtual Network Name of an availability group. For more information about disaster recovery, see [JDBC driver support for High Availability, disaster recovery](jdbc-driver-support-for-high-availability-disaster-recovery.md). |
| serverNameAsACE<br/><br/>boolean<br/>["true" &#124; "false"]<br/><br/>false | (Version 6.0+) Set to "true" to indicate that the driver should translate the Unicode server name to ASCII compatible encoding (Punycode) for the connection. If this setting is false, the driver uses the server name as provided to connect.<br/><br/> For more information about international features, see [International features of the JDBC driver](international-features-of-the-jdbc-driver.md). |
| serverPreparedStatement...<br/>DiscardThreshold<br/><br/>Integer<br/><br/>10 | (Version 6.2+) This property can be used to control how many outstanding prepared statement discard actions (<code>sp_unprepare</code>) can be outstanding per connection before a call to clean up the outstanding handles on the server is executed. <br/><br/> If this property is set to &lt;= 1, unprepare actions are executed immediately on prepared statement close. If it's set to &gt;1, these calls are batched together to avoid overhead of calling sp_unprepare too often. |
| serverSpn<br/><br/>String<br/><br/>null | (Version 4.2+) This optional property can be used to specify the Service Principal Name (SPN) for a Java Kerberos connection.  It's used with **authenticationScheme**.<br/><br/> To specify the SPN, it can be in the form of: "MSSQLSvc/fqdn:port@REALM" where fqdn is the fully qualified domain name, port is the port number, and REALM is the Kerberos realm of the SQL Server in upper-case letters.<br/><br/> Note: the @REALM is optional if the default realm of the client (as specified in the Kerberos configuration) is the same as the Kerberos realm for the SQL Server.<br/><br/> For more information about using **serverSpn** with Java Kerberos, see [Using Kerberos integrated authentication to connect to SQL Server](using-kerberos-integrated-authentication-to-connect-to-sql-server.md). |
| socketFactoryClass<br/><br/>String<br/><br/>null | (Version 8.4+) Specifies the class name for a custom socket factory to be used instead of the default socket factory. |
| socketTimeout<br/><br/>int<br/><br/>0 | The number of milliseconds to wait before a timeout is occurred on a socket read or accept. The default value is 0, which means infinite timeout. |
| statementPooling...<br/>CacheSize<br/><br/>int<br/><br/>0 | (Version 6.4+) This property can be used to enable prepared statement handle caching in the driver. <br/><br/>This property defines the size of the cache for statement pooling. <br/><br/>This property can only be used with the **disableStatementPooling** connection property, which should be set to "false". Setting **disableStatementPooling** to "true" or **statementPoolingCacheSize** to 0 disables prepared statement handle caching.|
| sslProtocol<br/><br/>String<br/><br/>TLS | (Version 6.4+) This property can be used to specify the TLS protocol to be considered during secure connection. <br/>Possible values are: **TLS**, **TLSv1**, **TLSv1.1**, and **TLSv1.2**. <br/><br/>For more information about the Secure Sockets Layer protocol, see [SSLProtocol](https://github.com/Microsoft/mssql-jdbc/wiki/SSLProtocol). |
| transparentNetwork...<br/>IPResolution<br/><br/>boolean<br/>["true" &#124; "false"]<br/><br/>true | (Version 6.0+) This property provides faster detection of and connection to the (currently) active server. Possible values are "true" and "false" where "true" is the default value.<br/><br/> Before Microsoft JDBC Driver 6.0 for SQL Server, an application had to set the connection string to include "multiSubnetFailover=true" to indicate that it was connecting to an Always On Availability Group. Without setting the **multiSubnetFailover** connection keyword to "true", an application might experience a timeout while connecting to an Always On Availability Group. With version 6.0 and up, an application isn't required to set multiSubnetFailover to true anymore. <br/><br/>**Note:** When transparentNetworkIPResolution=true, the first connection attempt uses 500 ms as the timeout. Any later attempts use the same timeout logic as used by the multiSubnetFailover property. |
| trustManagerClass<br/><br/>String<br/><br/>null | (Version 6.4+) The fully qualified class name of a custom <code>javax.net.ssl.TrustManager</code> implementation. |
| trustManager...<br/>ConstructorArg<br/><br/>String<br/><br/>null | (Version 6.4+) An optional argument to pass to the constructor of the TrustManager. If trustManagerClass is specified and an encrypted connection is requested, the custom TrustManager is used instead of the default system JVM keystore-based TrustManager. |
| trustServerCertificate<br/><br/>boolean<br/>["true" &#124; "false"]<br/><br/>false | Set to "true" to specify that the driver doesn't validate the server TLS/SSL certificate.<br/><br/> If "true", the server TLS/SSL certificate is automatically trusted when the communication layer is encrypted using TLS.<br/><br/> If "false", the driver validates the server TLS/SSL certificate. If the server certificate validation fails, the driver raises an error and closes the connection. The default value is "false". Make sure the value passed to **serverName** exactly matches the Common Name (CN) or DNS name in the Subject Alternate Name in the server certificate for a TLS/SSL connection to succeed. For more information about encryption support, see [Understanding encryption support](understanding-ssl-support.md).<br/><br/> **Note:** This property is used in combination with the **encrypt**/**authentication** properties. This property only affects server TLS/SSL certificate validation if the connection uses TLS encryption. |
| trustStore<br/><br/>String<br/><br/>null | The path (including filename) to the certificate trustStore file. The trustStore file contains the list of certificates that the client trusts.<br/><br/> When this property is unspecified or set to null, the driver relies on the trust manager factory's lookup rules to determine which certificate store to use.<br/><br/> **The default SunX509 TrustManagerFactory tries to locate the trusted material in the following search order:**<br/><br/> A file specified by the "javax.net.ssl.trustStore" JVM system property.<br/><br/> "&lt;java-home&gt;/lib/security/jssecacerts" file.<br/><br/> "&lt;java-home&gt;/lib/security/cacerts" file.<br/><br/> <br/><br/> For more information about the SUNX509 TrustManager Interface, see the SUNX509 TrustManager Interface documentation on the Sun Microsystems Web site.<br/><br/> **Note:** This property only affects the certificate trustStore lookup, if the connection uses TLS encryption and the **trustServerCertificate** property is set to "false". |
| trustStorePassword<br/><br/>String<br/><br/>null | The password used to check the integrity of the trustStore data.<br/><br/> If the trustStore property is set but the trustStorePassword property isn't set, the integrity of the trustStore isn't checked.<br/><br/> When both trustStore and trustStorePassword properties are unspecified, the driver uses the JVM system properties, "javax.net.ssl.trustStore" and "javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword". If the "javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword" system property isn't specified, the integrity of the trustStore isn't checked.<br/><br/> If the trustStore property isn't set but the trustStorePassword property is set, the JDBC driver uses the file that is specified by the "javax.net.ssl.trustStore" as a trust store and the integrity of the trust store is checked by using the specified trustStorePassword. This setting is needed when the client application doesn't want to store the password in the JVM system property.<br/><br/> **Note:**  The trustStorePassword property only affects the certificate trustStore lookup, if the connection uses TLS connection and the **trustServerCertificate** property is set to "false". |
| trustStoreType<br/><br/>String<br/><br/>JKS | Set this property to specify trust store type to be used for FIPS mode. <br/><br/>Possible values are either **PKCS12** or type defined by FIPS provider. |
| useBulkCopyFor...<br/>BatchInsert<br/><br/>boolean<br/>["true" &#124; "false"]<br/><br/>false | (Version 9.2+) This connection property can be enabled to transparently use the Bulk Copy API when doing batch insert operations using `java.sql.PreparedStatement`. This feature potentially provides much higher performance when enabled. <br/><br/>This feature is disabled by default. Set this property to "true" to enable this feature. <br/></br> **Important Note:** This feature only supports fully parameterized INSERT queries. If the INSERT queries are combined by other SQL queries, or contain data in values, execution falls back to the basic batch insert operation. <br/><br/> For more information about how to use this property, see [Using bulk copy API for batch insert operation](use-bulk-copy-api-batch-insert-operation.md)|
| useFmtOnly<br /><br />boolean<br />["true" &#124; "false"]<br /><br />false | (Version 7.4+) Provides an alternative way to query Parameter Metadata from the server. Set this property to "true" to specify that the driver should use `SET FMTONLY` logic when querying Parameter Metadata. This feature is off by default, and it isn't recommended to use this property as `SET FMTONLY` is marked for deprecation. **useFmtOnly** is made available to use only as a workaround for known issues and limitations in [`sp_describe_undeclared_parameters`](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-describe-undeclared-parameters-transact-sql.md).<br/><br/> This feature currently only supports single `SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE` queries. Attempting to use this feature with unsupported/multiple queries will cause the driver to attempt to parse the query(s), but will most likely result in an exception.<br/><br/> For more information about this property, see [Retrieving ParameterMetaData via useFmtOnly](using-usefmtonly.md). |
| userName,<br/>user<br/><br/>String<br/>[&lt;=128 char]<br/><br/>null | The database user, if connection with SQL user and password.<br/><br/>For Kerberos connection with principal name and password, this property is set to Kerberos Principal name.<br/><br/>(Version 10.2+) When **authentication=ActiveDirectoryServicePrincipal**, the **userName** property specifies a valid Azure Active Directory secure client ID.  |
| workstationID<br/><br/>String<br/>[&lt;=128 char]<br/><br/>&lt;empty string&gt; | The workstation ID. Used to identify the specific workstation in various profiling and logging tools. <br/><br/>If none is specified, the &lt;empty string&gt; is used. |
| xopenStates<br/><br/>boolean<br/>["true" &#124; "false"]<br/><br/>false | Set to "true" to specify that the driver returns XOPEN-compliant state codes in exceptions. <br/><br/>The default is to return SQL 99 state codes. |

> [!NOTE]
> The [!INCLUDE[jdbcNoVersion](../../includes/jdbcnoversion_md.md)] takes the server default values for connection properties except for ANSI_DEFAULTS and IMPLICIT_TRANSACTIONS. The [!INCLUDE[jdbcNoVersion](../../includes/jdbcnoversion_md.md)] automatically sets ANSI_DEFAULTS to ON and IMPLICIT_TRANSACTIONS to OFF.

> [!Important]
