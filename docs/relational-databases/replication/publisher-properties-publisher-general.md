# Publisher Properties - Publisher, General
  The **General** page of the **Publisher Properties** dialog box displays read-only information on the Distributor and distribution database that the Publisher uses. To change the Distributor or distribution database for a Publisher:  
  
1.  Disable publishing on the Publisher. For more information, see [Disable Publishing and Distribution](../../relational-databases/replication/disable-publishing-and-distribution.md).  
  
2.  Reconfigure publishing and distribution. For more information, see [Configure Publishing and Distribution](../../relational-databases/replication/configure-publishing-and-distribution.md).
