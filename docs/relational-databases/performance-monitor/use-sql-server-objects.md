# Use SQL Server Objects
 [!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

  Microsoft [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] provides objects and counters that can be used by System Monitor to monitor activity in computers running an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. An object is any [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] resource, such as a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] lock or Windows process. Each object contains one or more counters that determine various aspects of the objects to monitor. For example, the **SQL Server Locks** object contains counters called **Number of Deadlocks/sec** and **Lock Timeouts/sec**.  
  
 Some objects have several instances if multiple resources of a given type exist on the computer. For example, the **Processor** object type will have multiple instances if a system has multiple processors. The **Databases** object type has one instance for each database on [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Some object types (for example, the **Memory Manager** object) have only one instance. If an object type has multiple instances, you can add counters to track statistics for each instance, or in many cases, all instances at once. Counters for the default instance appear in the format **SQLServer:**_\<object name>_. Counters for named instances appear in the format **MSSQL$**_\<instance name>_**:**_\<counter name>_ or **SQLAgent$**_\<instance name>_**:**_\<counter name>_.  
  
[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] performance counter values are generated using the Windows Performance Counter (WPC) engine. Some counter values are not calculated directly by [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)]. The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] provides base values to the WPC engine, which will perform the required calculations (like percentages). The [sys.dm_os_performance_counters &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-os-performance-counters-transact-sql.md) dynamic management view provides all counters with the original value generated by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. The `cntr_type` column indicates the type of counter. How the WPC engine processes [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] counter values depends on this type. For more information about performance counter types, see the [WMI documentation](/windows/win32/wmisdk/wmi-performance-counter-types).
  
 By adding or removing counters to the chart and saving the chart settings, you can specify the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] objects and counters that are monitored when System Monitor is started.  
  
 You can configure System Monitor to display statistics from any [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] counter. In addition, you can set a threshold value for any [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] counter and then generate an alert when a counter exceeds a threshold. For more information about setting an alert, see [Create a SQL Server Database Alert](../../relational-databases/performance-monitor/create-a-sql-server-database-alert.md).  
    
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] statistics are displayed only when an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is installed. If you stop and restart an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], the display of statistics is interrupted and resumes automatically. Also note that you will see [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] counters in the System Monitor snap-in even if [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is not running. On a clustered instance, performance counters only function on the node where [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is running.
