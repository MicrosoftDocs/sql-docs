# Diagnosing Problems with the JDBC Driver
[!INCLUDE[Driver_JDBC_Download](../../includes/driver_jdbc_download.md)]

  No matter how well an application is designed and developed, problems will inevitably occur. When they do, it is important to have some techniques for diagnosing those problems. When using the [!INCLUDE[jdbcNoVersion](../../includes/jdbcnoversion_md.md)], some common problems that can occur are not having the right driver version or being unable to connect to a database.  
  
 The topics in this section discuss a number of techniques for diagnosing these and other problems including error handling, checking the driver version, tracing, and troubleshooting connectivity issues.  
  
## In This Section  
  
|Topic|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|[Handling Errors](../../connect/jdbc/handling-errors.md)|Describes how to handle errors that are returned from [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].|  
|[Getting the Driver Version](../../connect/jdbc/getting-the-driver-version.md)|Describes how to determine which version of the JDBC driver is installed.|  
|[Tracing Driver Operation](../../connect/jdbc/tracing-driver-operation.md)|Describes how to enable tracing when using the JDBC driver.|  
|[Troubleshooting Connectivity](../../connect/jdbc/troubleshooting-connectivity.md)|Describes how to troubleshoot database connectivity.|  
|[Accessing Diagnostic Information in the Extended Events Log](../../connect/jdbc/accessing-diagnostic-information-in-the-extended-events-log.md)|Describes how to use information in the server's extended events log to understand connection failures.|
