# Managing Memory for In-Memory OLTP
  Memory-optimized tables require that sufficient memory exist to keep all of the rows and indexes in memory. Because memory is a finite resource, it is important that you understand and manage memory usage on your system. The topics in this section cover common memory use and management scenarios.  
  
## In this section  
  
|Section|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|[Estimate Memory Requirements for Memory-Optimized Tables](../relational-databases/in-memory-oltp/memory-optimized-tables.md)|Estimate a table's memory needs.|
