# Expression Builder (Integration Services)
  The **Expression Builder** dialog box provides a graphical user interface for building the expressions that property expressions use. You can access the **Expression Builder** dialog box from the custom task dialog boxes in [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../includes/ssis-md.md)] Designer, and from the **Properties** window in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)].  
  
 You can use the **Expression Builder** dialog box to perform the following tasks:  
  
-   Building the expressions  
  
-   Evaluating the expression  
  
 For more information, see [Integration Services &#40;SSIS&#41; Expressions](expressions/integration-services-ssis-expressions.md) and [Use Property Expressions in Packages](expressions/use-property-expressions-in-packages.md).
