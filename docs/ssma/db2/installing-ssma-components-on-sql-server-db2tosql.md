# Installing SSMA Components on SQL Server (DB2ToSQL)
In this version of SSMA there is no need for a separate install on [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] of the SSMA extension pack, which supports data migration, and DB2 providers to enable server-to-server connectivity.  
  
## SSMA for DB2 Extension Pack  
The SSMA extension pack adds a schema the database in the specified instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. The **sysdb** schema contains the tables and stored procedures that are required to migrate data, and the user-defined functions that emulate DB2 system functions.
