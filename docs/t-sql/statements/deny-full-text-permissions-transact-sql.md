# DENY Full-Text Permissions (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

  Denies permissions on a full-text catalog and full-text stoplists.  
  

 ![Topic link icon](../../database-engine/configure-windows/media/topic-link.gif "Topic link icon") [Transact-SQL Syntax Conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```syntaxsql
DENY permission [ ,...n ] ON  
    FULLTEXT   
        {  
           CATALOG :: full-text_catalog_name  
           |  
           STOPLIST :: full-text_stoplist_name  
        }  
    TO database_principal [ ,...n ] [ CASCADE ]  
        [ AS denying_principal ]  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Arguments
 *permission*  
 Is the name of a permission. The valid mappings of permissions to securables are described in the "Remarks" section, later in this topic.  
  
 ON FULLTEXT CATALOG **::**_full-text_catalog_name_  
 Specifies the full-text catalog on which the permission is being denied. The scope qualifier **::** is required.  
  
 ON FULLTEXT STOPLIST **::**_full-text_stoplist_name_  
 Specifies the full-text stoplist on which the permission is being denied. The scope qualifier **::** is required.  
  
 *database_principal*  
 Specifies the principal to which the permission is being denied. One of the following:  
  
-   database user  
  
-   database role  
  
-   application role  
  
-   database user mapped to a Windows login  
  
-   database user mapped to a Windows group  
  
-   database user mapped to a certificate  
  
-   database user mapped to an asymmetric key  
  
-   database user not mapped to a server principal.  
  
 CASCADE  
 Indicates that the permission being denied is also denied to other principals to which it has been granted by this principal.  
  
 *denying_principal*  
 Specifies a principal from which the principal executing this query derives its right to deny the permission. One of the following:  
  
-   database user  
  
-   database role  
  
-   application role  
  
-   database user mapped to a Windows login  
  
-   database user mapped to a Windows group  
  
-   database user mapped to a certificate  
  
-   database user mapped to an asymmetric key  
  
-   database user not mapped to a server principal.  
  
  
## FULLTEXT CATALOG Permissions  
 A full-text catalog is a database-level securable contained by the database that is its parent in the permissions hierarchy. The most specific and limited permissions that can be denied on a full-text catalog are listed in the following table, together with the more general permissions that include them by implication.  
  
|Full-text catalog permission|Implied by full-text catalog permission|Implied by database permission|  
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|  
|CONTROL|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|TAKE OWNERSHIP|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|ALTER|CONTROL|ALTER ANY FULLTEXT CATALOG|  
|REFERENCES|CONTROL|REFERENCES|  
|VIEW DEFINITION|CONTROL|VIEW DEFINITION|  
  
## FULLTEXT STOPLIST Permissions  
 A full-text stoplist is a database-level securable contained by the database that is its parent in the permissions hierarchy. The most specific and limited permissions that can be denied on a full-text stoplist are listed in the following table, together with the more general permissions that include them by implication.  
  
|Full-text stoplist permission|Implied by full-text stoplist permission|Implied by database permission|  
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|  
|ALTER|CONTROL|ALTER ANY FULLTEXT CATALOG|  
|CONTROL|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|REFERENCES|CONTROL|REFERENCES|  
|TAKE OWNERSHIP|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|VIEW DEFINITION|CONTROL|VIEW DEFINITION|  
  
## Permissions  
 Requires CONTROL permission on the full-text catalog. If using the AS option, the specified principal must own the full-text catalog.
