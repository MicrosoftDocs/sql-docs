# SQL Server Login Password Expiration
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
  This rule checks whether "Password expiration" of each [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login is enabled. If [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication is enabled and if the operating system version is earlier than [!INCLUDE[winxpsvr](../../includes/winxpsvr-md.md)], an attacker could repeatedly exploit a known [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login password.  
  
## Best Practices Recommendations  
 We recommend that you upgrade the operating system to [!INCLUDE[winxpsvr](../../includes/winxpsvr-md.md)].  
  
 If [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication is not required in your environment, use Windows Authentication. For more information, see [Choose an Authentication Mode](../../relational-databases/security/choose-an-authentication-mode.md).  
  
 Enable "Password expiration" for all the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] logins. Use [ALTER LOGIN](../../t-sql/statements/alter-login-transact-sql.md) to configure the password policy for the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login.
