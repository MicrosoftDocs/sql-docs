# SQLConnect
  When a connection is opened, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client sets SQL_COPT_SS_MUTUALLY_AUTHENTICATED and SQL_COPT_SS_INTEGRATED_AUTHENTICATION_METHOD to the authentication method used to open the connection. For more information about SPNs, see [Service Principal Names &#40;SPNs&#41; in Client Connections &#40;ODBC&#41;](../native-client/odbc/service-principal-names-spns-in-client-connections-odbc.md).
