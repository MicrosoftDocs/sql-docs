# Static Aggregate Geometry Methods
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2012-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2012-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] supports the following aggregate methods as extensions to the static geometry methods of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  These aggregate methods are exposed only in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. They are not exposed in the Microsoft.SqlServer.Types assembly.
