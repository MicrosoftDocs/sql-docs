## SQL Server Technologies  

 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] includes several data management and analysis technologies. Click on the links in the following table to find the feature, task, and reference documentation for each technology.  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|![Database Engine icon](media/database-engine.gif "Database Engine icon")|[Database Engine](../database-engine/sql-server-database-engine-overview.md)<br /><br /> The Database Engine is the core service for storing, processing and securing data. The Database Engine provides controlled access and rapid transaction processing to meet the requirements of the most demanding data consuming applications within your enterprise. The Database Engine also provides rich support for sustaining high availability.|  
|![DQS Logo for BOL home topic](media/dqs-logo.jpg "DQS Logo for BOL home topic")|[Data Quality Services](../data-quality-services/data-quality-services.md)<br /><br /> SQL Server Data Quality Services (DQS) provides you with a knowledge-driven data cleansing solution. DQS enables you to build a knowledge base, and then use that knowledge base to perform data correction and deduplication on your data, using both computer-assisted and interactive means. You can use cloud-based reference data services, and you can build a data management solution that integrates DQS with SQL Server Integration Services and Master Data Services.|  
|![Analysis Services icon](media/analysisserver.gif "Analysis Services icon")|[Analysis Services](../analysis-services/analysis-services.md)<br /><br /> [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] is an analytical data platform and toolset for personal, team, and corporate business intelligence. Servers and client designers support traditional OLAP solutions, new tabular modeling solutions, as well as self-service analytics and collaboration using PowerPivot, Excel, and a SharePoint Server environment. [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] also includes Data Mining so that you can uncover the patterns and relationships hidden inside large volumes of data.|  
|![Integration Services icon](media/dts.gif "Integration Services icon")|[Integration Services](../integration-services/sql-server-integration-services.md)<br /><br /> [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] is a platform for building high performance data integration solutions, including packages that provide extract, transform, and load (ETL) processing for data warehousing.|  
|![mds_cm_icon](media/mds-cm-icon.gif "mds_cm_icon")|[Master Data Services](../master-data-services/master-data-services.md)<br /><br /> [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] is the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] solution for master data management. A solution built on [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] helps ensure that reporting and analysis is based on the right information. Using [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)], you create a central repository for your master data and maintain an auditable, securable record of that data as it changes over time.|  
|![Replication icon](media/replication.gif "Replication icon")|[Replication](../relational-databases/replication/sql-server-replication.md)<br /><br /> Replication is a set of technologies for copying and distributing data and database objects from one database to another, and then synchronizing between databases to maintain consistency. By using replication, you can distribute data to different locations and to remote or mobile users by means of local and wide area networks, dial-up connections, wireless connections, and the Internet.|  
|![Reporting Services icon](media/reportingservices.gif "Reporting Services icon")|[Reporting Services](../reporting-services/create-deploy-and-manage-mobile-and-paginated-reports.md)<br /><br /> Reporting Services delivers enterprise, Web-enabled reporting functionality so you can create reports that draw content from a variety of data sources, publish reports in various formats, and centrally manage security and subscriptions.|
