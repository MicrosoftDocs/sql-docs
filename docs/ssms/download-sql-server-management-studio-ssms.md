>[!NOTE]
>SSMS 17.0 is based on the Visual Studio 2015 Isolated shell, which was released before Windows Server 2016. Microsoft takes app compatibility very seriously and ensures that already-shipped applications continue to run on the latest Windows releases. Because of this, we do not anticipate that SSMS with all latest updates applied) will encounter issues when running on Windows Server 2016. Customers are advised to contact support, should they encounter any issues with SSMS on Windows Server 2016. Support will then work with customers to determine if the issue is with SSMS or Visual Studio or with Windows compatibility, and route the issue appropriately.
