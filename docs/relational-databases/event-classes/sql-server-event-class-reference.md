# SQL Server Event Class Reference
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]
  [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../includes/sssqlprofiler-md.md)] lets you record events as they occur in an instance of the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)]. The recorded events are instances of the event classes in the trace definition. In [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../includes/sssqlprofiler-md.md)], event classes and their event categories are available on the **Events Selection** tab of the **Trace File Properties** dialog box.  
  
 The following table describes the event categories and lists their associated event classes.
