# Bitmap Warning Event Class
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]
  The **Bitmap Warning** event class can be used to monitor bitmap filter usage in queries. The event subclass can be used to report when bitmap filters have been disabled in a query.  
  
## Bitmap Warning Event Class Data Columns  
  
|Data column name|Data type|Description|Column ID|Filterable|  
|----------------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|  
|**ApplicationName**|**nvarchar**|Name of the client application that created the connection to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. This column is populated with the values passed by the application rather than the displayed name of the program.|10|Yes|  
|**ClientProcessID**|**int**|ID assigned by the host computer to the process where the client application is running. This data column is populated if the client provides the client process ID.|9|Yes|  
|**DatabaseID**|**int**|Identifier of the database specified by the USE *database* statement or the default database if no USE *database* statement has been issued for a given instance. [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../includes/sssqlprofiler-md.md)] displays the name of the database if the **ServerName** data column is captured in the trace and the server is available. Determine the value for a database by using the DB_ID function.|3|Yes|  
|**DatabaseName**|**nvarchar**|Name of the database in which the user statement is running.|35|Yes|  
|**EventClass**|**int**|Type of event = 212.|27|No|  
|**EventSequence**|**int**|Sequence of a given event within the request.|51|No|  
|**EventSubClass**|**int**|Type of event subclass. 0 = bitmap filter is disabled.|21|Yes|  
|**HostName**|**nvarchar**|Name of the computer on which the client is running. This data column is populated if the host name is provided by the client. To determine the host name, use the HOST_NAME function.|8|Yes|  
|**IsSystem**|**int**|Indicates whether the event occurred on a system process or a user process. 1 = system, 0 = user.|60|Yes|  
|**LoginName**|**nvarchar**|Name of the login of the user (either [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] security login or the Windows login credentials in the form of *DOMAIN\username*).|11|Yes|  
|**LoginSid**|**image**|Security identification number (SID) of the logged-in user. You can find this information in the **sys.server_principals** catalog view. Each SID is unique for each login in the server.|41|Yes|  
|**NTDomainName**|**nvarchar**|Windows domain to which the user belongs.|7|Yes|  
|**NTUserName**|**nvarchar**|Windows user name.|6|Yes|

|**RequestID**|**int**|The ID of the request containing the statement.|49|Yes|  
|**ServerName**|**nvarchar**|Name of the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] being traced.|26|No|  
|**SessionLoginName**|**nvarchar**|Login name of the user that originated the session. For example, if you connect to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] using Login1 and execute a statement as Login2, **SessionLoginName** shows Login1 and **LoginName** shows Login2. This column displays both [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and Windows logins.|64|Yes|  
|**SPID**|**int**|ID of the session on which the event occurred.|12|Yes|  
|**StartTime**|**datetime**|Time that the event started, if available.|14|Yes|
