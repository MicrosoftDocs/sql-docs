# Open and Close a Report (Report Manager)
  You can use Report Manager to view reports that have been published to a report server. By default, all reports open in HTML. After a report is open, you can export it to view it in other application formats. If the report contains interactive features or if it is a Report Builder report that contains interactive data, you can click the links to view additional reports or data.  
  
### To view a report  
  
1.  Start [Report Manager  &#40;SSRS Native Mode&#41;](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/80949f9d-58f5-48e3-9342-9e9bf4e57896).  
  
2.  Find a report by browsing folders or searching for a report by name. Browse folder contents by clicking a folder name or folder icon in the **Contents** page. Search for a report by typing all or part of the report name in the **Search for** text box at the top of the page.  
  
3.  To view a report, click a report name or an icon. The following icon indicates a report:  
  
     ![Report icon](../../reporting-services/report-server/media/hlp-16doc.gif "Report icon")  
  
     Some reports require you to provide either a user name and password or a parameter value  
  
4.  To close the report, close Report Manager or browse to another page or folder (for example, by clicking the **Back** button or clicking a folder link at the top of the page).  
  
     Closing a report does not remove it from the browser cache. You must close the browser to disconnect the report.
