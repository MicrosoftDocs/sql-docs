# O2SS0265: Unable to convert condition (Error)

This article describes why SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Oracle does not convert the statement having `CURSOR` attributes with any conditional operator.

## Background

A `CURSOR` is a mechanism by which you can assign a name to a `SELECT` statement and manipulate the information within that SQL statement. Cursors are used by database programmers to process individual rows returned by database system queries.

Although SSMA facilitates emulation of various cursor attributes, it generates an error message when it encounters cursor statement with some conditional logic, like `IS NULL`, etc.

## Example

Consider the example below that has been designed to check whether the `CURSOR` values are fetched or not. Also, the below code will give you the list of the entire employee numbers from the `EMP` table.

```sql
DECLARE
    emp_no emp.empno%TYPE;
    CURSOR c1 IS select empno from emp;
BEGIN
    OPEN c1;

    IF (c1%FOUND IS NULL) THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Cursor Is Not Found');
    ELSE
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Cursor Found');
    END IF;

    LOOP
        FETCH c1 INTO emp_no;

        EXIT WHEN c1%NOTFOUND;

        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(emp_no);
    END LOOP;

    CLOSE c1;
END;
```

When you try to convert the above code in SSMA, it generates the following error message:

> O2SS0265: Unable to convert condition

## Possible remedies

The solution to the above error is to rewrite the conditional block in the SQL Server after converting the code using SSMA. Majority of the code gets converted, as there is only one conditional block, thus you only have to modify small portion of the logic. The `FOUND` attribute is converted to `IF @@FETCH_STATUS = 0` and the `NOTFOUND` attribute is converted to `IF @@FETCH_STATUS <> 0`. Below is the manually converted code:

```sql
BEGIN
    DECLARE
        @emp_no numeric(4, 0)

    DECLARE
        c1 CURSOR LOCAL
        FOR
            SELECT EMP.EMPNO
            FROM dbo.EMP

    OPEN c1

    IF (@@FETCH_STATUS) = 0
    BEGIN
        PRINT 'Cursor Found'
    END
    ELSE
        PRINT 'Cursor Is Not Found'

    WHILE 1 = 1
    BEGIN
        FETCH c1 INTO @emp_no

        IF @@FETCH_STATUS <> 0
            BREAK

        PRINT @emp_no
    END

    CLOSE c1
    DEALLOCATE c1
END
```

> [!NOTE]
> In general practice, the cursor should be fetched before doing any operation on `CURSOR` attributes. So for the above example, make sure to execute `FETCH c1 INTO @emp_no` before doing any operations on the cursor.
