# Symmetric Keys on User Databases
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
  This rule checks whether keys that have a length of less than 128 bytes do not use the RC2 or RC4 encryption algorithm.  
  
## Best Practices Recommendations  
 Use AES 128 bit or larger to create symmetric keys for data encryption. If AES is not supported by your operating system, use 3DES.  
  
## For More Information
