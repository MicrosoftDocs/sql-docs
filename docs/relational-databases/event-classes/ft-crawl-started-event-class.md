# FT:Crawl Started Event Class
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]
  The **FT:Crawl Started** event class indicates that a full-text crawl (population) has started. Use this event class to check if a crawl request is actually being picked up by worker tasks.
