# Create a Leaf Member (Master Data Services)
  In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)], create a leaf member when you want to add master data to your system and are not using staging tables or the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssMDSXLS](../includes/ssmdsxls-md.md)] to import data.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform this procedure:  
  
-   You must have permission to access the **Explorer** functional area.  
  
-   You must have a minimum of **Update** permission to the leaf model object for the entity you are adding a member to.  
  
### To create a leaf member  
  
1.  On the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)] home page, from the **Model** list, select a model.  
  
2.  If you are a user, select an open version from the **Version** list. If you are an administrator, select a version with open or locked status from the **Version** list.  
  
3.  Click **Explorer**.  
  
4.  From the menu bar, point to **Entities** and click the name of the entity you want to add a member to.  
  
5.  Click **Add member**.  
  
6.  In the **Details** pane, complete the fields.  
  
7.  Optional. In the **Annotations** box, type a comment about why the member was added. All users who have access to the member can view the annotation.  
  
8.  Click **OK**.
