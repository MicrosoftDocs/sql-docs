# Improving Performance and Reliability with the JDBC Driver
[!INCLUDE[Driver_JDBC_Download](../../includes/driver_jdbc_download.md)]

  One aspect of application development that is common to all applications is the constant need to improve performance and reliability. There are a number of techniques for doing this with the [!INCLUDE[jdbcNoVersion](../../includes/jdbcnoversion_md.md)].  
  
 The topics in this section describe various techniques for improving application performance and reliability when using the JDBC driver.  
  
## In This Section  
  
|Topic|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|[Closing Objects when Not In Use](../../connect/jdbc/closing-objects-when-not-in-use.md)|Describes the importance of closing JDBC driver objects when they are no longer needed.|  
|[Managing Transaction Size](../../connect/jdbc/managing-transaction-size.md)|Describes techniques for improving transaction performance.|  
|[Working with Statements and Result Sets](../../connect/jdbc/working-with-statements-and-result-sets.md)|Describes techniques for improving performance when using the Statement or ResultSet objects.|  
|[Using Adaptive Buffering](../../connect/jdbc/using-adaptive-buffering.md)|Describes an adaptive buffering feature, which is designed to retrieve any kind of large-value data without the overhead of server cursors.|  
|[Sparse Columns](../../connect/jdbc/sparse-columns.md)|Discusses the JDBC driver's support for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] sparse columns.|
