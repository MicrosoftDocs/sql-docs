# Changes to CPU and memory limits for SQL Server Reporting Services Standard and Enterprise
  [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] Reporting Services Standard and Enterprise supports a maximum of 64 gigabytes of system memory.  
  
## Component  
 [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)]  
  
### Description  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Reporting Services Standard and Enterprise supports a maximum of 64 gigabytes of system memory. You may need to reconfigure your current system settings to align with the new limits.  
  
 For more information about CPU and memory limits for other editions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], see [Compute Capacity Limits by Edition of SQL Server](../compute-capacity-limits-by-edition-of-sql-server.md), and [Memory Supported by the Editions of SQL Server](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=212633).  
  
## Corrective Action  
 You may need to reconfigure your current system settings to align with the new CPU and memory limits. For more information, see [ALTER SERVER CONFIGURATION &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](/sql/t-sql/statements/alter-server-configuration-transact-sql), and [Server Memory Server Configuration Options](../../database-engine/configure-windows/server-memory-server-configuration-options.md).
