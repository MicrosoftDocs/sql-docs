# SQL Server Migration Assistant for Access (AccessToSQL)

[!INCLUDE [msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Access is a tool for migrating databases from [!INCLUDE [msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Access versions 97 through 2010, to [!INCLUDE [sssql11-md](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../../includes/sssql22-md.md)] on Windows and Linux, or [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)]. SSMA for Access converts Access database objects to [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or Azure SQL objects, loads those objects into [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or Azure SQL, and then migrates data from Access to [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or Azure SQL.

This documentation introduces you to SSMA for Access and provides step-by-step instructions for migrating Access databases to [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or Azure SQL Database and information about issues that might occur after migration.
