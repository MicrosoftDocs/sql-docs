# Tutorials for SQL Server 2014
  [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] introduces many new technologies and features.  
  
 There are plans to provide additional tutorials in the future. Meanwhile, you can continue to learn from the [!INCLUDE[ssKilimanjaro](../includes/sskilimanjaro-md.md)] tutorials. In some cases, you might find minor differences between the user interface in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssKilimanjaro](../includes/sskilimanjaro-md.md)] and there might be subtle differences in tutorial prerequisites. If a tutorial uses one of the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBCoShort](../includes/sssampledbcoshort-md.md)] databases, you should download and use the [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] version.  
  
 If you are using a [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] server, you have the [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] data providers installed. In order for the tutorials to work, you will either need the [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] sample databases that work with those providers, or you need the [!INCLUDE[ssKilimanjaro](../includes/sskilimanjaro-md.md)] data providers that work with the [!INCLUDE[ssKilimanjaro](../includes/sskilimanjaro-md.md)] version of the sample databases.
