# Transaction Isolation
*Transaction isolation* refers to the degree of interaction between multiple concurrent transactions. To see why this is important, you'll need to first look at the idea of serializability.  
  
 This section contains the following topics.  
  
-   [Serializability](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/serializability.md)  
  
-   [Transaction Isolation Levels](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/transaction-isolation-levels.md)  
  
-   [Setting the Transaction Isolation Level](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/setting-the-transaction-isolation-level.md)  
  
-   [Scrollable Cursors and Transaction Isolation](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/scrollable-cursors-and-transaction-isolation.md)
