# Publication Type
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server SQL MI](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]
  Replication provides the following types of publications:  
  
-   Snapshot publication  
  
-   Transactional publication  
  
-   Merge publication  
  
 Which type or types of replication you choose for your application depends on the physical replication environment, the type and quantity of data to be replicated, and whether or not data is updated at the Subscriber. The physical environment includes the number and location of computers involved in replication, and whether these computers are clients (workstations, laptops, or handheld devices) or servers. For more information, see [Types of Replication](../../relational-databases/replication/types-of-replication.md).
