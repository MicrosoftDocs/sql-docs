# Delete an Attribute Group (Master Data Services)
  In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)], delete an attribute group when you no longer need the tab to display in the **Explorer** functional area of [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)].  
  
-   **Note** When attribute groups exist, attributes that do not belong to an attribute group are not displayed in **Explorer**. When no attribute groups exist, all attributes are displayed.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform this procedure:  
  
-   You must have permission to access the **System Administration** functional area.  
  
-   You must be a model administrator. For more information, see [Administrators &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](administrators-master-data-services.md).  
  
### To delete an attribute group  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)], click **System Administration**.  
  
2.  On the **Model View** page, from the menu bar, point to **Manage** and click **Attribute Groups**.  
  
3.  From the **Model** list, select a model.  
  
4.  From the **Entity** list, select an entity.  
  
5.  Click the plus sign to expand **Leaf Groups**, **Consolidated Groups**, or **Collection Groups**, depending on the type of group you want to delete.  
  
6.  Click the attribute group you want to delete.  
  
7.  Click **Delete selected group**.
