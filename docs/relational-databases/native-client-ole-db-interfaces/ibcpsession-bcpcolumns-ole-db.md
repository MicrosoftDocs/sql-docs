# IBCPSession::BCPColumns (OLE DB)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md.md)]
[!INCLUDE[SNAC_Deprecated](../../includes/snac-deprecated.md)]

  Sets the number of fields that are to be bound to the columns in a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] table.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
HRESULT BCPColumns(   
      DBCOUNTITEM nColumns);  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 Internally it calls [IBCPSession::BCPColFmt](../../relational-databases/native-client-ole-db-interfaces/ibcpsession-bcpcolfmt-ole-db.md) to set the default values for field data. These default values are obtained from the SQL Server column information that the provider internally retrieves when the table name is specified through [IBCPSession::BCPInit](../../relational-databases/native-client-ole-db-interfaces/ibcpsession-bcpinit-ole-db.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  This method can be called only after **BCPInit** has been called with a valid file name.  
  
 You should call this method only if you intend to use a user-file format that differs from the default. For more information about a description of the default user-file format, see the **BCPInit** method.  
  
 After calling the **BCPColumns** method, you must call the **BCPColFmt** method for each column in the user file to completely define a custom file format.  
  
## Arguments  
 *nColumns*[in]  
 The total number of fields in the user file. Even if you are preparing to bulk copy data from the user file to a SQL Server table and do not intend to copy all fields in the user file, you must still set the *nColumns* argument to the total number of user-file fields. The skipped fields can then be specified through **BCPColFmt**.  
  
## Return Code Values  
 S_OK  
 The method succeeded.  
  
 E_FAIL  
 A provider-specific error occurred; for detailed information, use the [ISQLServerErrorInfo](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/a8323b5c-686a-4235-a8d2-bda43617b3a1) interface.  
  
 E_UNEXPECTED  
 The call to the method was unexpected. For example, the **BCPInit** method was not called before calling this method. Also occurs when this method is called more than once for a bulk copy operation.  
  
 E_OUTOFMEMORY  
 Out-of-memory error.
