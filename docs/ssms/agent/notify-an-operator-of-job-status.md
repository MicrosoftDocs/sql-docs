# Notify an Operator of Job Status
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdbmi-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdbmi-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> On [Azure SQL Database Managed Instance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance), most, but not all SQL Server Agent features are currently supported. See [Azure SQL Database Managed Instance T-SQL differences from SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-transact-sql-information#sql-server-agent) for details.

This topic describes how to set notification options in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)], or SQL Server Management Objects, so [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent can send notifications to operators about jobs.

#### To notify an operator of job status  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer,** connect to an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion_md.md)], and then expand that instance.  
  
2.  Expand **SQL Server Agent**, expand **Jobs**, right-click the job you want to edit, and select **Properties**.  
  
3.  In the **Job Properties** dialog box, select the **Notifications** page.  
  
4.  If you want to notify an operator by e-mail, check **E-mail**, select an operator from the list, and then select one of the following:  
  
    -   **When the job succeeds** to notify the operator when the job completes successfully.  
  
    -   **When the job fails** to notify the operator when the job completes unsuccessfully.  
  
    -   **When the job completes** to notify the operator regardless of completion status.  
  
5.  If you want to notify an operator by pager, check **Page**, select an operator from the list, and then select one of the following:  
  
    -   **When the job succeeds** to notify the operator when the job completes successfully.  
  
    -   **When the job fails** to notify the operator when the job completes unsuccessfully.  
  
    -   **When the job completes** to notify the operator regardless of completion status.  
  
6.  If you want to notify an operator by net send, check **Net send**, select an operator from the list, and then select one of the following:  
  
    -   **When the job succeeds** to notify the operator when the job completes successfully.  
  
    -   **When the job fails** to notify the operator when the job completes unsuccessfully.  
  
    -   **When the job completes** to notify the operator regardless of completion status.  
  
## <a name="TSQL"></a>Using Transact-SQL  
  
#### To notify an operator of job status  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer**, connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde_md.md)].  
  
2.  On the Standard bar, click **New Query**.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and click **Execute**.  
  
    ```  
    -- adds an e-mail notification for the specified alert (Test Alert).  
    -- This example assumes that Test Alert already exists
    --  and that François Ajenstat is a valid operator name.  
    USE msdb ;  
    GO  
    EXEC dbo.sp_add_notification   
    @alert_name = N'Test Alert',   
    @operator_name = N'François Ajenstat',   
    @notification_method = 1 ;  
    GO  
    ```

## <a name="SMO"></a>Using SQL Server Management Objects  
**To notify an operator of job status**  
  
Use the **Job** class by using a programming language that you choose, such as Visual Basic, Visual C#, or PowerShell. For more information, see [SQL Server Management Objects (SMO)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms162169.aspx).
