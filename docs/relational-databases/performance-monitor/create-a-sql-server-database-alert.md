# Create a SQL Server Database Alert
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
  You can use System Monitor to create an alert that is raised when a threshold value for a System Monitor counter has been reached. In response to the alert, System Monitor launches an application, such as a custom application written to handle the alert condition. For example, you could create an alert that is raised when the number of deadlocks exceeds a specific value.  
  
 Alerts also can be defined by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent. For more information, see [Alerts](../../ssms/agent/alerts.md).  
  
 For more information about using System Monitor to set up a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database alert, see [Set Up a SQL Server Database Alert &#40;Windows&#41;](../../relational-databases/performance/set-up-a-sql-server-database-alert-windows.md) .
