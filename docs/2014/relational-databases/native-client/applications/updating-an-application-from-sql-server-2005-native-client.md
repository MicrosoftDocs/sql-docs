# Updating an Application from SQL Server 2005 Native Client
  This topic discusses the breaking changes in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client since [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client in [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../../includes/ssversion2005-md.md)].  
  
 When you upgrade from Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client, you might also see some behavior differences. For more information, see [Updating an Application to SQL Server Native Client from MDAC](updating-an-application-to-sql-server-native-client-from-mdac.md).  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client 9.0 shipped with [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../../includes/ssversion2005-md.md)]. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client 10.0 shipped with [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)].  [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client 10.5 shipped with [!INCLUDE[ssKilimanjaro](../../../includes/sskilimanjaro-md.md)]. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client 11.0 shipped with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../../includes/sssql14-md.md)].  
  
|Changed behavior in SQL Server Native Client Since [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../../includes/ssversion2005-md.md)]|Description|  
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|  
|OLE DB pads only to the defined scale.|For conversions where converted data is sent to the server, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client (beginning in [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)]) pads trailing zeros in data only up to the maximum length of `datetime` values. SQL Server Native Client 9.0 padded to 9 digits.|  
|Validate DBTYPE_DBTIMESTAMP for ICommandWithParameter::SetParameterInfo.|[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client (beginning in [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)]) implements the OLE DB requirement for *bScale* in ICommandWithParameter::SetParameterInfo to be set to the fractional seconds' precision for DBTYPE_DBTIMESTAMP.|  
|The `sp_columns` stored procedure now returns **"NO"** instead of **"NO "** for the IS_NULLABLE column.|Beginning in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client 10.0 ([!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)]), `sp_columns` stored procedure now returns **"NO"** instead of **"NO "** for an IS_NULLABLE column.|  
|SQLSetDescRec, SQLBindParameter, and SQLBindCol now perform consistency checking.|Prior to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client 10.0, setting SQL_DESC_DATA_PTR did not cause a consistency check for any descriptor type in SQLSetDescRec, SQLBindParameter, or SQLBindCol.|  
|SQLCopyDesc now does descriptor consistency checking.|Prior to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client 10.0, SQLCopyDesc did not do a consistency check when the SQL_DESC_DATA_PTR field was set on a particular record.|  
|SQLGetDescRec no longer does a descriptor consistency check.|Prior to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client 10.0, SQLGetDescRec performed a descriptor consistency check when the SQL_DESC_DATA_PTR field was set. This was not required by the ODBC specification and in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client 10.0 ([!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)]) and later versions, this consistency check is no longer performed.|  
|Different error returned when date is out of range.|For the `datetime` type, a different error number will be returned by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client (beginning in [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)]) for an out-of-range date than was returned in earlier versions.<br /><br /> Specifically, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client 9.0 returned 22007 for all out of range year values in string conversions to `datetime`, and [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client beginning with version 10.0 ([!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)]) returns 22008 when the date is within the range supported by `datetime2` but outside the range supported by `datetime` or `smalldatetime`.|  
|`datetime` value truncates fractional seconds and not round if rounding will change the day.|Prior to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client 10.0, the client behavior for `datetime` values sent to the server is to round them to nearest 1/300th of a second. Beginning in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client 10.0, this scenario causes a truncation of fractional seconds if rounding changes the day.|  
|Possible trunction of seconds for `datetime` value.|An application built with [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)] Native Client (or later) that connects to a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2005 server will truncate seconds and fractional seconds for time portion of data sent to the server if you bind to a datetime column with a type identifier of DBTYPE_DBTIMESTAMP (OLE DB) or SQL_TIMESTAMP (ODBC) and a scale of 0.<br /><br /> For example:<br /><br /> Input data: 1994-08-21 21:21:36.000<br /><br /> Inserted data: 1994-08-21 21:21:00.000|  
|OLE DB data conversion from DBTYPE_DBTIME to DBTYPE_DATE no longer can cause the day to change.|Prior to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client 10.0, if the time part of a DBTYPE_DATE was within a half second of midnight, OLE DB conversion code caused the day to change. Beginning in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client 10.0, the day will not change (fractional seconds are truncated and not rounded).|  
|IBCPSession::BCColFmt conversion changes.|Beginning in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client 10.0, when you use IBCPSession::BCOColFmt to convert SQLDATETIME or SQLDATETIME to a string type, a fractional value is exported. For example, when converting type SQLDATETIME to type SQLNVARCHARMAX, earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client returned<br /><br /> 1989-02-01 00:00:00. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client 10.0 and later versions return 1989-02-01 00:00:00.0000000.|  
|Size of data sent must match length specified in SQL_LEN_DATA_AT_EXEC.|When using SQL_LEN_DATA_AT_EXEC, the size of the data must match the length that you specified with SQL_LEN_DATA_AT_EXEC. You can use SQL_DATA_AT_EXEC but there are potential performance benefits to using SQL_LEN_DATA_AT_EXEC.|  
|Custom applications that use the BCP API can now see a warning.|The BCP API will generate a warning message if data length is greater than the specified length for a field for all types. Previously, this warning was only given for character types, but will not be issued for all types.|  
|Inserting an empty string into a `sql_variant` bound as a date/time type generates an error.|In [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client 9.0, inserting an empty string into a `sql_variant` bound as a date/time type did not generate an error. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client 10.0 (and later) correctly generates an error in this situation.|  
|Stricter SQL_C_TYPE _TIMESTAMP and DBTYPE_DBTIMESTAMP parameter validation.|Prior to [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)] Native Client, `datetime` values were rounded to fit the scale of `datetime` and `smalldatetime` columns by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)] Native Client (and later) applies the stricter validation rules that are defined in the ODBC core specification for fractional seconds. If a parameter value cannot be converted to the SQL type by using the scale specified or implied by the client binding without truncation of trailing digits, an error is returned.|  
|[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] might return different results when a trigger runs.|Changes introduced in [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)] might cause an application to have different results returned from a statement that caused a trigger to run when `NOCOUNT OFF` was in effect. In this situation, your application might generate an error. To resolve this error, set `NOCOUNT ON` in the trigger or call SQLMoreResults to advance to the next result.|
