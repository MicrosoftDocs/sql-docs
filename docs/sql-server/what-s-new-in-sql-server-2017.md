## SQL Server 2017 Database Engine

SQL Server 2017 includes many new Database Engine features, enhancements, and performance improvements. 
- **CLR assemblies** can now be added to a list of trusted assemblies, as a workaround for the `clr strict security` feature described in CTP 2.0. [sp_add_trusted_assembly](../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sys-sp-add-trusted-assembly-transact-sql.md), [sp_drop_trusted_assembly](../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sys-sp-drop-trusted-assembly-transact-sql.md), and [sys.trusted_asssemblies](../relational-databases/system-catalog-views/sys-trusted-assemblies-transact-sql.md) are added to support the list of trusted assemblies (RC1).  
- **Resumable online index rebuild** resumes an online index rebuild operation from where it stopped after a failure (such as a failover to a replica or insufficient disk space), or pauses and later resumes an online index rebuild operation. See [ALTER INDEX](../t-sql/statements/alter-index-transact-sql.md) and [Guidelines for online index operations](../relational-databases/indexes/guidelines-for-online-index-operations.md). (CTP 2.0)
- The **IDENTITY_CACHE** option for ALTER DATABASE SCOPED CONFIGURATION allows you to avoid gaps in the values of identity columns if a server restarts unexpectedly or fails over to a secondary server. See [ALTER DATABASE SCOPED CONFIGURATION](../t-sql/statements/alter-database-scoped-configuration-transact-sql.md). (CTP 2.0)
- A new generation of query processing improvements that will adapt optimization strategies to your application workload's runtime conditions. For this first version of the **adaptive query processing** feature family, we have three new improvements: **batch mode adaptive joins**, **batch mode memory grant feedback**, and **interleaved execution** for multi-statement table valued functions.  See [Intelligent query processing in SQL databases](../relational-databases/performance/intelligent-query-processing.md).
- **Automatic database tuning** provides insight into potential query performance problems, recommends solutions, and can automatically fix identified problems. See [Automatic tuning](../relational-databases/automatic-tuning/automatic-tuning.md). (CTP 2.0)
- New **graph database capabilities** for modeling many-to-many relationships include new [CREATE TABLE](../t-sql/statements/create-table-sql-graph.md) syntax for creating node and edge tables, and the keyword [MATCH](../t-sql/queries/match-sql-graph.md) for queries. See [Graph Processing with SQL Server 2017](../relational-databases/graphs/sql-graph-overview.md). (CTP 2.0)
- An sp_configure option called `clr strict security` is enabled by default to enhance the security of CLR assemblies. See [CLR strict security](../database-engine/configure-windows/clr-strict-security.md). (CTP 2.0)
- Setup now allows specifying initial tempdb file size up to **256 GB** (262,144 MB) per file, with a warning if the file size is set greater than 1GB with IFI not enabled. (CTP 2.0)
- The **modified_extent_page_count** column in [sys.dm_db_file_space_usage](../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-db-file-space-usage-transact-sql.md) tracks differential changes in each database file, enabling smart backup solutions that perform differential backup or full backup based on percentage of changed pages in the database. (CTP 2.0)
- [SELECT INTO](../t-sql/queries/select-into-clause-transact-sql.md) T-SQL syntax now supports loading a table into a FileGroup other than the user's default by using the **ON** keyword. (CTP 2.0)
- Cross database transactions are now supported among all databases that are part of an **Always On Availability Group**, including databases that are part of same instance. See [Transactions - Always On Availability Groups and Database Mirroring](../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/transactions-always-on-availability-and-database-mirroring.md) (CTP 2.0)
- New **Availability Groups** functionality includes read-scale support without a cluster, Minimum Replica Commit Availability Groups setting, and Windows-Linux cross-OS migrations and testing. (CTP 1.3)
- New dynamic management views:
    - [sys.dm_db_log_stats](../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-db-log-stats-transact-sql.md) exposes summary level attributes and information on transaction log files, helpful for monitoring transaction log health. (CTP 2.1)
    - [sys.dm_tran_version_store_space_usage](../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-tran-version-store-space-usage.md) tracks version store usage per database, useful for proactively planning tempdb sizing based on the version store usage per database. (CTP 2.0)
    - [sys.dm_db_log_info](../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-db-log-info-transact-sql.md) exposes VLF information to monitor, alert, and avert potential transaction log issues. (CTP 2.0)
    - [sys.dm_db_stats_histogram](../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-db-stats-histogram-transact-sql.md) is a new dynamic management view for examining statistics. (CTP 1.3)
    - **sys.dm_os_host_info** provides operating system information for both Windows and Linux. (CTP 1.0)
- The **Database Tuning Advisor (DTA)** has additional options and improved performance. (CTP 1.2)
- **In-memory enhancements** include support for computed columns in memory-optimized tables, full support for JSON functions in natively compiled modules, and the CROSS APPLY operator in natively compiled modules. (CTP 1.1)
- New **string functions** are CONCAT_WS, TRANSLATE, and TRIM, and WITHIN GROUP is now supported for the STRING_AGG function. (CTP 1.1)
- There are new **bulk access options** (BULK INSERT and OPENROWSET(BULK...) ) for CSV and Azure Blob files. (CTP 1.1)
- **Memory-optimized object enhancements** include sp_spaceused and elimination of the 8 index limitation for memory-optimized tables, sp_rename for memory-optimized tables and natively compiled T-SQL modules, and CASE and TOP (N) WITH TIES for natively compiled T-SQL modules. Memory-optimized filegroup files can now be stored, backed up and restored on Azure Storage. (CTP 1.0)
- **DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL** is a new class of securable, supporting CONTROL, ALTER, REFERENCES, TAKE OWNERSHIP, and VIEW DEFINITION permissions. ADMINISTER DATABASE BULK OPERATIONS is now visible in sys.fn_builtin_permissions. (CTP 1.0)
- Database **COMPATIBILITY_LEVEL 140** is added. (CTP 1.0).

## Machine Learning in SQL Server 2017 

SQL Server R Services has been renamed **SQL Server Machine Learning Services**, to reflect support for Python in addition to the R language. You can use Machine Learning Services (In-Database) to run R or Python scripts in SQL Server, or install **Microsoft Machine Learning Server (Standalone)** to deploy and consume R and Python models that don't require SQL Server. 

SQL Server developers now have access to the extensive Python ML and AI libraries available in the open-source ecosystem, along with the latest innovations from Microsoft:

- **revoscalepy** - This Python equivalent of RevoScaleR includes parallel algorithms for linear and logistic regressions, decision tree, boosted trees and random forests, as well as a rich set of APIs for data transformation and data movement, remote compute contexts, and data sources.
- **microsoftml** - This state-of-the-art package of machine learning algorithms and transforms with Python bindings includes deep neural networks, fast decision trees and decision forests, and optimized algorithms for linear and logistic regressions. You also get pre-trained models based on ResNet models that you can use for image extraction or sentiment analysis.
- **Python operationalization with T-SQL** - Deploy Python code easily by using the stored procedure `sp_execute_external_script`. Get great performance by streaming data from SQL to Python processes and using MPI ring parallelization.
- **Python in SQL Server compute contexts** - Data scientists and developers can execute Python code remotely from their development environments to explore data and develop models without moving data around.
- **Native scoring** -  The PREDICT function in Transact-SQL can be used to perform scoring in any instance of SQL Server 2017, even if R isn't installed. All that's required is that you train the model using one of the supported RevoScaleR and revoscalepy algorithms and save the model in a new, compact binary format.
- **Package management** - T-SQL now supports the CREATE EXTERNAL LIBRARY statement, to give DBAs greater management over R packages. Use roles to control private or shared package access, store R packages in the database and share them among users.
- **Performance improvements** - The stored procedure `sp_execute_external_script` has been optimized to support batch mode execution for columnstore data.
