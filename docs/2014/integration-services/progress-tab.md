# Progress Tab
  Use the **Progress** tab of [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../includes/ssis-md.md)] Designer to view the progress of execution of an [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] package when you run the package in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)]. The **Progress** tab lists the start time, the finish time, and the elapsed time for validation and execution of the package and its executables; any information or warnings for the package; progress notifications; the success or failure of the package; and any error messages that are generated during package execution.  
  
 To enable or disable the display of messages on the **Progress** tab, toggle the **Debug Progress Reporting** option on the **SSIS** menu. Disabling progress reporting can help improve performance while running a complex package in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudio](../includes/ssbidevstudio-md.md)].  
  
 After the package stops running, the **Progress** tab becomes the **Execution Results** tab.
