# Cluster Node Configuration (Complete)
  Use the Cluster Node Configuration (Complete) page to specify an existing instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] that has been prepared for clustering.To install or upgrade a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] failover cluster, you must run the Setup program on each node of the failover cluster. To add a node to an existing [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] failover cluster, you must run [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup on the node that is to be added to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] failover cluster instance.  
  
## Options  
 From the drop-down boxes:  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance name - Select the instance name for the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] failover cluster.  
  
-   Name of this node - This field is pre-populated with the computer name where the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup program is running.  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Failover Cluster Network Name - This field is not pre-populated. Specify the network name for the new [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] failover cluster instance. This is the name that identifies the failover cluster instance on the network.
