Not nullable.<br /><br />In Azure SQL Database, may return the number of logical CPUs on the machine hosting the database or elastic pool. To determine the number of logical CPUs available to the database or elastic pool, use the `cpu_limit` column in [sys.dm_user_db_resource_governance](sys-dm-user-db-resource-governor-azure-sql-database.md).|  
|**hyperthread_ratio**|**int**|Specifies the ratio of the number of logical or physical cores that are exposed by one physical processor package. Not nullable.|  
|**physical_memory_in_bytes**|**bigint**|**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[ssKilimanjaro](../../includes/sskilimanjaro-md.md)].<br /><br /> Specifies the total amount of physical memory on the machine. Not nullable.|  
|**physical_memory_kb**|**bigint**|**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] and later.<br /><br /> Specifies the total amount of physical memory on the machine. Not nullable.<br /><br />In Azure SQL Database, returns the total amount of physical memory on the machine hosting the database or elastic pool. To determine the amount of physical memory available to the database or elastic pool, use the `process_memory_limit_mb` column in [sys.dm_os_job_object](sys-dm-os-job-object-transact-sql.md).|  
|**virtual_memory_in_bytes**|**bigint**|**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[ssKilimanjaro](../../includes/sskilimanjaro-md.md)].<br /><br /> Amount of virtual memory available to the process in user mode. This can be used to determine whether SQL Server was started by using a 3-GB switch.|  
|**virtual_memory_kb**|**bigint**|**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] and later.<br /><br /> Specifies the total amount of virtual address space available to the process in user mode. Not nullable.|  
|**bpool_committed**|**int**|**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[ssKilimanjaro](../../includes/sskilimanjaro-md.md)].<br /><br /> Represents the committed memory in kilobytes (KB) in the memory manager. Does not include reserved memory in the memory manager. Not nullable.|  
|**committed_kb**|**int**|**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] and later.<br /><br /> Represents the committed memory in kilobytes (KB) in the memory manager. Does not include reserved memory in the memory manager. Not nullable.|  
|**bpool_commit_target**|**int**|**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[ssKilimanjaro](../../includes/sskilimanjaro-md.md)].<br /><br /> Represents the amount of memory, in kilobytes (KB), that can be consumed by SQL Server memory manager.|  
|**committed_target_kb**|**int**|**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] and later.<br /><br /> Represents the amount of memory, in kilobytes (KB), that can be consumed by SQL Server memory manager. The target amount is calculated using a variety of inputs like:<br /><br /> - the current state of the system including its load<br /><br /> - the memory requested by current processes<br /><br /> - the amount of memory installed on the computer<br /><br /> - configuration parameters<br /><br /> If `committed_target_kb` is larger than `committed_kb`, the memory manager will try to obtain additional memory. If `committed_target_kb` is smaller than `committed_kb`, the memory manager will try to shrink the amount of memory committed. The `committed_target_kb` always includes stolen and reserved memory. Not nullable.|  
|**bpool_visible**|**int**|**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[ssKilimanjaro](../../includes/sskilimanjaro-md.md)].<br /><br /> Number of 8-KB buffers in the buffer pool that are directly accessible in the process virtual address space. When not using the Address Windowing Extensions (AWE), when the buffer pool has obtained its memory target (bpool_committed = bpool_commit_target), the value of bpool_visible equals the value of bpool_committed.When using AWE on a 32-bit version of SQL Server, bpool_visible represents the size of the AWE mapping window used to access physical memory allocated by the buffer pool. The size of this mapping window is bound by the process address space and, therefore, the visible amount will be smaller than the committed amount, and can be further reduced by internal components consuming memory for purposes other than database pages. If the value of bpool_visible is too low, you might receive out of memory errors.|
