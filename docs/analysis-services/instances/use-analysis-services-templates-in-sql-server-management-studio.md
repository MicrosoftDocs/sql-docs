# Use Analysis Services Templates in SQL Server Management Studio
[!INCLUDE[ssas-appliesto-sqlas-all-aas](../../includes/ssas-appliesto-sqlas-all-aas.md)]

  [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] provides a set of templates to help you quickly create XMLA scripts, DMX or MDX queries, create KPIs in a cube or tabular model, script backup and restore operations, and perform many other tasks. Templates are located in the **Template Explorer** in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)].  
  
 This topic includes a list of the templates for multidimensional models and tabular models, and provides examples of how to build an MDX query and XMLA statement by using the Metadata Explorer and the Template Explorer.  
  
 This topic does not cover DMX templates. For examples of how to create data mining queries using the templates, see [Create a DMX Query in SQL Server Management Studio](../../analysis-services/data-mining/create-a-dmx-query-in-sql-server-management-studio.md) or [Create a Singleton Prediction Query from a Template](../../analysis-services/data-mining/create-a-singleton-prediction-query-from-a-template.md).  
  
##  <a name="bkmk_usingTE"></a> Open an Analysis Services Template  
 All templates for database engine queries and Analysis Services queries and commands are available in Template Explorer.  
  
 To open **Template Explorer**, select it from the **View** menu. Next, click the cube icon to see a list of the templates that are available for [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 ![Template Explorer, filtered for Analysis Services](../../analysis-services/instances/media/ssas-templateexplorer.gif "Template Explorer, filtered for Analysis Services")  
  
 To open a template, right-click the template name and select **Open**, or drag the template into a query window that you already opened. After the query window is open, you can use commands on the toolbar or Query menu to help you build statements:  
  
-   To check the syntax of a query, click **Parse**.  
  
-   To run a query, click **Execute**.  
  
     To stop a query that is running, click **Cancel Executing Query**.  
  
-   View the results of a query in the **Results** tab at the bottom of the screen.  
  
     Switch to the **Messages** tab to see the number of records returned, errors, query statements, and any other messages that are associated with the execution of the query. For example, if you execute a DAX statement against a model running in Direct Query mode, you can see the Transact-SQL statement that is generated by the xVelocity in-memory analytics engine (VertiPaq).  
  
##  <a name="BKMK_Building_Queries"></a> Build and Run an MDX Query on a Tabular Model using a Template  
 This example shows you how to create an MDX query in SQL Server Management Studio, using a tabular model database as the data source. To repeat this example on your computer, you can [download the Adventureworks tabular model sample project](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=231183).  
  
> [!WARNING]  
>  You cannot use MDX queries against tabular models that have been deployed in Direct Query mode. You can, however, send equivalent queries by using the DAX table queries with the EVALUATE command. For more information, see [DAX Query Parameters](http://msdn.microsoft.com/c5841b4e-3395-4237-815b-9822a691e544).  
  
#### Create an MDX query from a template  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], open the instance that contains the tabular model you want to query. Right-click the database icon, select **New Query**, and then select **MDX**.  
  
2.  In Template Browser, in Analysis Services Templates, open **MDX**, and then open **Queries**. Drag **Basic Query** to the query window.  
  
3.  Using **Metadata Explorer**, drag the following fields and measures into the query template:  
  
    1.  Replace \<row_axis, mdx_set> with **[Product Category].[Product Category Name]**.  
  
    2.  Replace \<column_axis, mdx_set> with **[Date].[Calendar Year].[Calendar Year]**.  
  
    3.  Replace \<from_clause, mdx_name> with **[Internet Sales]**.  
  
    4.  Replace \<where_clause, mdx_set> with **[Measures].[Internet Total Sales]**.  
  
4.  You can execute the query as is, but you will probably want to make some changes, such as adding a function to return specific members. For example, type **.members** after **[Product Category].[Product Category Name]**. For more information, see [Using Member Expressions](../../mdx/using-member-expressions.md).  
  
##  <a name="bkmk_backup"></a> Create XMLA Script from a Template  
 The XMLA command templates that are provided in Template Explorer can be used to create scripts for monitoring and updating [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] objects, regardless of whether the instance is in multidimensional and data mining mode, or tabular mode. The **XMLA** templates include samples for the following types of scripts:  
  
-   Backup, restore, and synchronize operations  
  
-   Cancel specified process or command  
  
-   Process an object  
  
-   Discover schema rowsets  
  
-   Monitor server status, including jobs, connections, transactions, memory, and performance counters  
  
#### Create a backup command script from a template  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], open the instance that contains the database you want to query. Right-click the database icon, select **New Query**, and then select **XMLA**.  
  
    > [!WARNING]  
    >  You cannot set the context of an XMLA query by changing the restriction list, or by specifying a database in the connection dialog. You must open the XMLA query window from the database that you want to query.  
  
2.  Drag the **Backup** template into the empty query window.  
  
3.  Double-click the text within the \<DatabaseID> element.  
  
4.  In Object Explorer, select the database you want to backup, and drag and drop the database between the brackets of the DatabaseID element.  
  
5.  Double-click the text within the \<File> element. Type the name of the backup file, including the .abf file extension. Specify the full file path if you are not using the default backup location. For more information, see [Backing Up, Restoring, and Synchronizing Databases &#40;XMLA&#41;](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models-scripting-language-assl-xmla/backing-up-restoring-and-synchronizing-databases-xmla.md).  
  
##  <a name="bkmk_schemarowset"></a> Generate a Schema Rowset Query using an XMLA Template  
 The **Template Explorer** contains only one template for schema rowset queries. To use this template, you must be familiar with the requirements of the individual schema rowset that you want to use, including any required elements, and the columns that can be used as restrictions. For more information, see [Analysis Services Schema Rowsets](https://docs.microsoft.com/bi-reference/schema-rowsets/analysis-services-schema-rowsets).  
  
 Note that many of the schema rowsets have also been exposed as Dynamic Management Views (DMV) for simplicity. By using the corresponding DMV, you can query the schema rowset using syntax like that of Transact-SQL. For example, the following queries return the same results, but one is in XML format, and one is in a tabular format. For more information about DMVs, see [Use Dynamic Management Views &#40;DMVs&#41; to Monitor Analysis Services](../../analysis-services/instances/use-dynamic-management-views-dmvs-to-monitor-analysis-services.md).  
  
 DMV that returns a list of all schema rowsets available as DMVs:  
  
```  
SELECT * FROM $system.DISCOVER_SCHEMA_ROWSETS  
```  
  
 XMLA command that returns list of available schema rowsets:  
  
```  
<Discover xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xml-analysis">  
<RequestType>DISCOVER_SCHEMA_ROWSETS</RequestType>  
    <Restrictions>  
<RestrictionList>  
</RestrictionList>  
</Restrictions>  
    <Properties>  
<PropertyList>  
   </PropertyList>  
</Properties>  
</Discover>  
```  
  
#### Get a list of data sources for a tabular model using a schema rowset query  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], open the instance that contains the database you want to query. Right-click the database icon, select **New Query**, and then select **XMLA**.  
  
    > [!WARNING]  
    >  You cannot set the context of an XMLA query by changing the restriction list, or by specifying a database in the connection dialog. You must open the XMLA query window from the database that you want to query.  
  
2.  Open **Template Explorer**, and drag the template, **Discover Schema Rowsets**, into the blank query window.  
  
3.  In the template, replace the [RequestType Element &#40;XMLA&#41;](https://docs.microsoft.com/bi-reference/xmla/xml-elements-properties/requesttype-element-xmla) element with the following text: `<RequestType>MDSCHEMA_INPUT_DATASOURCES</RequestType>`  
  
4.  Click **Execute**.  
  
     Expected results:  
  
    ```
