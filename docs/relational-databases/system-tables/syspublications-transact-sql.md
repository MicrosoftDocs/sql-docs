|**alt_snapshot_folder**|**nvarchar(255)**|Specifies the location of the alternate folder for the snapshot.|  
|**pre_snapshot_script**|**nvarchar(255)**|Specifies a pointer to a **.sql** file location. The Distribution Agent runs the pre-snapshot script before running any of the replicated object scripts when applying a snapshot at a Subscriber.|  
|**post_snapshot_script**|**nvarchar(255)**|Specifies a pointer to a **.sql** file location. The Distribution Agent runs the post-snapshot script after all the other replicated object scripts and data have been applied during an initial synchronization.|

|**ftp_address**|**sysname**|The network address of the FTP service for the Distributor. Specifies where publication snapshot files are located for the Distribution Agent to pick up.|  
|**ftp_port**|**int**|The port number of the FTP service for the Distributor. Specifies where the publication snapshot files are located for the Distribution Agent to pick up|  
|**ftp_subdirectory**|**nvarchar(255)**|Specifies where the snapshot files will be available for the Distribution Agent to pick up if the publication supports propagating snapshots using FTP.|
