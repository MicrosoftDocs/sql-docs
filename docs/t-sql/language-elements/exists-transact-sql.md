# EXISTS (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE [sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

  Specifies a subquery to test for the existence of rows.  
  
 ![Topic link icon](../../database-engine/configure-windows/media/topic-link.gif "Topic link icon") [Transact-SQL Syntax Conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```syntaxsql  
EXISTS ( subquery )  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Arguments
 *subquery*  
 Is a restricted SELECT statement. The INTO keyword is not allowed. For more information, see the information about subqueries in [SELECT &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/queries/select-transact-sql.md).  
  
## Result Types  
 **Boolean**  
  
## Result Values  
 Returns TRUE if a subquery contains any rows.  
  
## Examples  
  
### A. Using NULL in a subquery to still return a result set  
 The following example returns a result set with `NULL` specified in the subquery and still evaluates to TRUE by using `EXISTS`.  
  
```sql  
-- Uses AdventureWorks  
  
SELECT DepartmentID, Name   
FROM HumanResources.Department   
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT NULL)  
ORDER BY Name ASC ;  
```  
  
### B. Comparing queries by using EXISTS and IN  
 The following example compares two queries that are semantically equivalent. The first query uses `EXISTS` and the second query uses `IN`.  
  
```sql  
-- Uses AdventureWorks  
  
SELECT a.FirstName, a.LastName  
FROM Person.Person AS a  
WHERE EXISTS  
(SELECT *   
    FROM HumanResources.Employee AS b  
    WHERE a.BusinessEntityID = b.BusinessEntityID  
    AND a.LastName = 'Johnson') ;  
GO  
```  
  
 The following query uses `IN`.  
  
```sql  
-- Uses AdventureWorks  
  
SELECT a.FirstName, a.LastName  
FROM Person.Person AS a  
WHERE a.LastName IN  
(SELECT a.LastName  
    FROM HumanResources.Employee AS b  
    WHERE a.BusinessEntityID = b.BusinessEntityID  
    AND a.LastName = 'Johnson') ;  
GO  
```  
  
 Here is the result set for either query.  
  
 ```
FirstName                                          LastName
-------------------------------------------------- ----------
Barry                                              Johnson
David                                              Johnson
Willis                                             Johnson
  
(3 row(s) affected)
 ```  
  
### C. Comparing queries by using EXISTS and = ANY  
 The following example shows two queries to find stores whose name is the same name as a vendor. The first query uses `EXISTS` and the second uses `=``ANY`.  
  
```sql  
-- Uses AdventureWorks  
  
SELECT DISTINCT s.Name  
FROM Sales.Store AS s   
WHERE EXISTS  
(SELECT *  
    FROM Purchasing.Vendor AS v  
    WHERE s.Name = v.Name) ;  
GO  
```  
  
 The following query uses `= ANY`.  
  
```sql  
-- Uses AdventureWorks  
  
SELECT DISTINCT s.Name  
FROM Sales.Store AS s   
WHERE s.Name = ANY  
(SELECT v.Name  
    FROM Purchasing.Vendor AS v ) ;  
GO  
```  
  
### D. Comparing queries by using EXISTS and IN  
 The following example shows queries to find employees of departments that start with `P`.  
  
```sql  
-- Uses AdventureWorks  
  
SELECT p.FirstName, p.LastName, e.JobTitle  
FROM Person.Person AS p   
JOIN HumanResources.Employee AS e  
   ON e.BusinessEntityID = p.BusinessEntityID   
WHERE EXISTS  
(SELECT *  
    FROM HumanResources.Department AS d  
    JOIN HumanResources.EmployeeDepartmentHistory AS edh  
       ON d.DepartmentID = edh.DepartmentID  
    WHERE e.BusinessEntityID = edh.BusinessEntityID  
    AND d.Name LIKE 'P%') ;  
GO  
```  
  
 The following query uses `IN`.  
  
```sql  
-- Uses AdventureWorks  
  
SELECT p.FirstName, p.LastName, e.JobTitle  
FROM Person.Person AS p JOIN HumanResources.Employee AS e  
   ON e.BusinessEntityID = p.BusinessEntityID   
JOIN HumanResources.EmployeeDepartmentHistory AS edh  
   ON e.BusinessEntityID = edh.BusinessEntityID   
WHERE edh.DepartmentID IN  
(SELECT DepartmentID  
   FROM HumanResources.Department  
   WHERE Name LIKE 'P%') ;  
GO  
```  
  
### E. Using NOT EXISTS  
 NOT EXISTS works the opposite of EXISTS. The WHERE clause in NOT EXISTS is satisfied if no rows are returned by the subquery. The following example finds employees who are not in departments which have names that start with `P`.  
  
```sql  
SELECT p.FirstName, p.LastName, e.JobTitle  
FROM Person.Person AS p   
JOIN HumanResources.Employee AS e  
   ON e.BusinessEntityID = p.BusinessEntityID   
WHERE NOT EXISTS  
(SELECT *  
   FROM HumanResources.Department AS d  
   JOIN HumanResources.EmployeeDepartmentHistory AS edh  
      ON d.DepartmentID = edh.DepartmentID  
   WHERE e.BusinessEntityID = edh.BusinessEntityID  
   AND d.Name LIKE 'P%')  
ORDER BY LastName, FirstName  
GO  
```

 ```

## Examples: [!INCLUDE[ssSDWfull](../../includes/sssdwfull-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssPDW](../../includes/sspdw-md.md)]  
  
### F. Using EXISTS  
 The following example identifies whether any rows in the `ProspectiveBuyer` table could be matches to rows in the `DimCustomer` table. The query will return rows only when both the `LastName` and `BirthDate` values in the two tables match.  
  
```sql
-- Uses AdventureWorks  
  
SELECT a.LastName, a.BirthDate  
FROM DimCustomer AS a  
WHERE EXISTS  
(SELECT *   
    FROM dbo.ProspectiveBuyer AS b  
    WHERE (a.LastName = b.LastName) AND (a.BirthDate = b.BirthDate)) ;  
```  
  
### G. Using NOT EXISTS  
 NOT EXISTS works as the opposite as EXISTS. The WHERE clause in NOT EXISTS is satisfied if no rows are returned by the subquery. The following example finds rows in the `DimCustomer` table where the `LastName` and `BirthDate` do not match any entries in the `ProspectiveBuyers` table.  
  
```sql  
-- Uses AdventureWorks  
  
SELECT a.LastName, a.BirthDate  
FROM DimCustomer AS a  
WHERE NOT EXISTS  
(SELECT *   
    FROM dbo.ProspectiveBuyer AS b  
    WHERE (a.LastName = b.LastName) AND (a.BirthDate = b.BirthDate)) ;  
```
