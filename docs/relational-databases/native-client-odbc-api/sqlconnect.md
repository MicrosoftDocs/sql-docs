# SQLConnect
[!INCLUDE[SQL Server Azure SQL Database Synapse Analytics PDW](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

  When a connection is opened, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client sets SQL_COPT_SS_MUTUALLY_AUTHENTICATED and SQL_COPT_SS_INTEGRATED_AUTHENTICATION_METHOD to the authentication method used to open the connection. For more information about SPNs, see [Service Principal Names &#40;SPNs&#41; in Client Connections &#40;ODBC&#41;](../../relational-databases/native-client/odbc/service-principal-names-spns-in-client-connections-odbc.md).
