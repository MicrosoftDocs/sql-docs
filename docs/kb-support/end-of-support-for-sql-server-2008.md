## Summary

Microsoft SQL Server 2008 and SQL Server 2008 R2 are approaching the end of [Extended Support](https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle). As of the dates in the table below, there will be no additional:

- Free security updates on-premises
- Non-security updates
- Free support options
- Online technical content updates

Customers who use these versions of SQL Server products and services should take one of the following steps:

- Upgrade to the latest version of SQL Server on-premises.
- Re-host to Azure SQL Database Managed Instance, which eliminates the need for future upgrades.
- Migrate to Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines.
  - This virtual machine option takes advantage of three additional years of **Critical** security updates at no additional charge. And customers can modernize whenever they are ready.
