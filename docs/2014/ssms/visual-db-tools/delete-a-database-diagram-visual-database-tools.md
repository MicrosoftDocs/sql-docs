# Delete a Database Diagram (Visual Database Tools)
  When you no longer need a database diagram, you can delete it.  
  
### To delete a database diagram  
  
1.  In Object Explorer, expand the **Database Diagrams** folder.  
  
2.  Right-click the database diagram that you want to delete.  
  
3.  Choose **Delete** on the shortcut menu.  
  
4.  A message prompts you to confirm the deletion. Choose **Yes**.  
  
 The database diagram is deleted from the database. When you delete a database diagram, the tables in the diagram are not deleted.
