# Functional Area Permissions (Master Data Services)
  You can assign permission to each of the functional areas of the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)] user interface (UI). There are five functional areas:  
  
-   **Explorer**  
  
-   **Version Management**  
  
-   **Integration Management**  
  
-   **System Administration**  
  
-   **User and Group Permissions**  
  
 When you assign permission to a functional area, you are making an area of the UI visible to the user or group.  
  
 Within the **Explorer** functional area, additional permissions assigned to model objects and hierarchy members determine which data a user can access. Within all other functional areas, a user must be a model administrator to view a model and act on it. For more information, see [Administrators &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](administrators-master-data-services.md).  
  
 A user or group must have permission to at least one functional area and one model on the **Models** tab in order to access [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)].
