  This article discusses OLE DB behavior that is specific to OLE DB Driver for SQL Server.  
  
## ICommand::Execute  
 Inserting data that is greater than the size of a column typically results in an error. However, there are situations where S_OK will be returned but the *dwStatus* will be set to DBSTATUS_S_TRUNCATED. It generally occurs when inserting data with parameters, where the column isn't large enough to hold the data, and **ICommandWithParameters::SetParameterInfo** hasn't been called.
