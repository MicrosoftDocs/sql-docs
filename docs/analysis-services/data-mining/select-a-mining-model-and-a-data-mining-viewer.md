# Select a Mining Model and a Data Mining Viewer
[!INCLUDE[ssas-appliesto-sqlas](../../includes/ssas-appliesto-sqlas.md)]
  You can explore a mining model by using one of the viewers on the **Mining Model Viewer** tab of Data Mining Designer. You can easily switch between models, or change the viewer that is used.  
  
-   The **Mining Model** drop-down list box on the **Mining Model Viewer** tab of Data Mining Designer in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] contains a list of all the mining models that are in the current mining structure.  
  
-   Custom viewers are provided for each type of model. For an overview of all the custom viewers, see [Mining Model Viewers &#40;Data Mining Model Designer&#41;](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/4ba391d5-c97b-4848-ba7c-7d096fa4b7dd). For a walkthrough of how to use the custom viewers to understand a model, see [Lesson 4: Exploring the Targeted Mailing Models &#40;Basic Data Mining Tutorial&#41;](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/1e00c5b9-a9f8-4503-99ee-377c9cc02d7f).  
  
-   The [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Generic Content Viewer shows the patterns discovered by the algorithm in a standard representation of nodes in a tree. Although the generic tree view shows all the content for the model in rich detail, it is more difficult to interpret. For more information, see [Browse a Model Using the Microsoft Generic Content Tree Viewer](../../analysis-services/data-mining/browse-a-model-using-the-microsoft-generic-content-tree-viewer.md).  
  
### To select a viewer type  
  
-   Select the viewer that is provided for the specific type of model that you created, using the **Viewer** list at the top of the **Mining Model Viewer** tab.  
  
-   Or, use the **Microsoft Generic Mining Content Viewer**  
  
### To select a mining model to view  
  
-   On the **Mining Model Viewer** tab in Data Mining Designer, select the mining model that you want to view from the **Mining Model** list.  
  
 The selected mining model opens in the viewer that is provided for that model type.
