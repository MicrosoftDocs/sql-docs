# Contents Page (Report Manager)
  Use the Contents page to view the contents of the current folder, select items to view, or navigate to other folders. This page opens when you select a folder. It is also the home page for Report Manager.  
  
 The Contents page shows the items that you have permission to view. Depending on the permissions you have, you may also be able to move, delete, and add items. You must click **Details View** to access the **Delete** and **Move** buttons. If you cannot see any items at all, check with your report server administrator. It may be that you have not been assigned to a role that provides access to report server content or operations.  
  
## Options  
 **New Folder**  
 Click to open the New Folder page, which is used to create a folder under the current folder.  
  
 **New Data Source**  
 Click to open the New Data Source page, which is used to create a shared data source item.  
  
 **Report Builder**  
 Click to start Report Builder. To access Report Builder from Report Manager, Report Builder must be enabled on the report server and you must have permission to use it. For more information, see [Configure Report Builder Access](report-server/configure-report-builder-access.md).  
  
 **Folder Settings**  
 Click to open and manage properties of the current folder.  
  
 **Upload File**  
 Click to open the Upload File page, which is used to copy a file from the file system to a report server. You can upload files to add reports and resources (such as charts, documents, or any other collateral content that you want to keep with a report). Uploaded files are stored in and managed from a report server database. To upload a report, select a file that has an .rdl extension.  
  
 **Details View**  
 Click to display the Contents page in a list that contains additional information about items. In **Details View**, you can use **Delete** and **Move** buttons to remove and relocate items in the folder.  
  
 Hover over an item and click the drop-down arrow to open the drop-down menu from which you can access and configure properties of the selected item.  
  
 **Tile View**  
 Click to display the Contents page without details as in **Details View**. List View is the default view when you open a folder or access the Report Manager Home page.  
  
 Hover over an item and click the drop-down arrow to open the drop-down menu from which you can access and configure properties of the selected item.  
  
 **Delete**  
 Click to remove a folder or other item. Before clicking **Delete**, select the check box next to each item that you want to delete.  
  
 **Move**  
 Click to relocate an item within the folder hierarchy. Before clicking **Move**, select the check box next to each item that you want to move. This opens the Move Items page, where you can browse through folders to select a new location.
