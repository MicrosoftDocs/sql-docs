# Editions and supported features of SQL Server 2019

[!INCLUDE [sqlserver2019](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2019.md)]

This article provides details of features supported by the various editions of [!INCLUDE[sssql19-md](../includes/sssql19-md.md)].

For information about other versions, see:

- [SQL Server 2022](editions-and-components-of-sql-server-2022.md)
- [SQL Server 2017](editions-and-components-of-sql-server-2017.md)
- [SQL Server 2016](editions-and-components-of-sql-server-2016.md)

For information about Azure SQL, see [Features comparison: Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance](/azure/azure-sql/database/features-comparison)

Installation requirements vary based on your application needs. The different editions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] accommodate the unique performance, runtime, and price requirements of organizations and individuals. The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] components that you install also depend on your specific requirements. The following sections help you understand how to make the best choice among the editions and components available in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].

The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Evaluation edition is available for a 180-day trial period.

For the latest release notes and what's new information, see the following:

- [[!INCLUDE[sssql19-md](../includes/sssql19-md.md)] release notes](../sql-server/sql-server-version-15-release-notes.md)
- [What's new in SQL Server 2019](../sql-server/what-s-new-in-sql-server-ver15.md)

**Try [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]!: [Download [!INCLUDE[sssql19-md](../includes/sssql19-md.md)] from the Evaluation Center](https://www.microsoft.com/evalcenter/evaluate-sql-server-2019)**

## SQL Server editions

The following table describes the editions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].

| [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] edition | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Enterprise | The premium offering, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssNoVersion-md.md)] Enterprise edition delivers comprehensive high-end datacenter capabilities with blazing-fast performance, unlimited virtualization <sup>1</sup>, and end-to-end business intelligence - enabling high service levels for mission-critical workloads and end-user access to data insights. |
| Standard | [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssNoVersion-md.md)] Standard edition delivers basic data management and business intelligence database for departments and small organizations to run their applications and supports common development tools for on-premises and cloud - enabling effective database management with minimal IT resources. |
| Web | [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssNoVersion-md.md)] Web edition is a low total-cost-of-ownership option for Web hosters and Web VAPs to provide scalability, affordability, and manageability capabilities for small to large-scale Web properties. |
| Developer | [!INCLUDE [ssdeveloper-md](../includes/ssdeveloper-md.md)] edition lets developers build any kind of application on top of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. It includes all the functionality of Enterprise edition, but is licensed for use as a development and test system, not as a production server. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Developer is an ideal choice for people who build and test applications. |
| Express editions | [!INCLUDE [ssexpress-md](../includes/ssexpress-md.md)] edition is the entry-level, free database and is ideal for learning and building desktop and small server data-driven applications. It is the best choice for independent software vendors, developers, and hobbyists building client applications. If you need more advanced database features, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Express can be seamlessly upgraded to other higher end versions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Express LocalDB is a lightweight version of Express that has all of its programmability features, runs in user mode and has a fast, zero-configuration installation and a short list of prerequisites. |

<sup>1</sup> Unlimited virtualization is available on Enterprise edition for customers with [Software Assurance](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/licensing-programs/software-assurance-default). Deployments must comply with the licensing guide. For more information, see our pricing and licensing page.

## Use SQL Server with client/server applications

You can install just the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] client components on a computer that is running client/server applications that connect directly to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. A client components installation is also a good option if you administer an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on a database server, or if you plan to develop [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] applications.

The client tools option installs the following [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] features: backward compatibility components, [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudio](../includes/ssbidevstudio-md.md)], connectivity components, management tools, software development kit, and [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Books Online components. For more information, see  [Install [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]](../database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server.md).

### Run with IIS

On an internet server, such as a server that is running Internet Information Services (IIS), you will typically install the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] client tools. Client tools include the client connectivity components used by an application connecting to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].

> [!NOTE]  
> Although you can install an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on a computer that is running IIS, this is typically done only for small Web sites that have a single server computer. Most Web sites have their middle-tier IIS systems on one server or a cluster of servers, and their databases on a separate server or federation of servers.

## Choose SQL Server features

Use the Feature Selection page of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Installation Wizard to select the components to include in an installation of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. By default, none of the features in the tree are selected.

<sup>4</sup> On Enterprise edition, the number of nodes is the operating system maximum. On Standard edition there is support for two nodes.

<sup>5</sup> On Enterprise edition, provides support for up to 8 secondary replicas - including 5 synchronous secondary replicas.

<sup>6</sup> Standard edition supports basic availability groups. A basic availability group supports two replicas, with one database.

<sup>1</sup> In-Memory OLTP data size and Columnstore segment cache are limited to the amount of memory specified by edition in the [Scale Limits](#Cross-BoxScaleLimits) section. The degree of parallelism (DOP) for [batch mode](../relational-databases/query-processing-architecture-guide.md#batch-mode-execution) operations is limited to 2 for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Standard edition and 1 for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Web and Express editions. This refers to columnstore indexes created over disk-based tables and memory-optimized tables.

<sup>2</sup> Aggregate Pushdown, String Predicate Pushdown, and SIMD Optimizations are [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Enterprise edition scalability enhancements. For more detail, see [Columnstore indexes - what's new](../relational-databases/indexes/columnstore-indexes-what-s-new.md).

<sup>1</sup> Basic integration is limited to 2 cores and in-memory data sets.

<sup>2</sup> Advanced integration can use all available cores for parallel processing of data sets at any size subject to hardware limits.

<sup>3</sup> Scale out with multiple compute nodes requires a head node.

<sup>4</sup> Prior to SQL Server 2019 PolyBase head node requires Enterprise edition.

<sup>5</sup> Client only
