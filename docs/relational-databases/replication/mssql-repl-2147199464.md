|Message Text|The replication Merge Agent failed to propagate a Publisher schema change to the Subscriber. When troubleshooting, restart the agent with a higher value for -HistoryVerboseLevel and check the output log file for errors. Correct any database engine conditions that may be causing internal replication stored procedures to fail.|  
  
## Explanation  
 A procedure that was called to perform this action failed.  
  
## User Action  
 Run [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../includes/sssqlprofiler-md.md)] and examine replmerg.log for failures. If you are using Web Synchronization, elevate the severity of the websync log, rerun the scenario, and check for errors in the websync.log file.  
  
 If you are using Web Synchronization, you can start Replmerg.exe and pass the **-T 106** option to use trace flag 106. This enables you to see the messages that are sent to and from the Publisher. By adding the trace flag to the Replmerg.exe agent command line, the agent writes the client's input messages to a file that is named ExchangeID(*guid*).IN.XML, and writes the output messages to a file that is named ExchangeID(*guid*).OUT.XML. (In these file names, *guid* is the GUID of the Exchange Server session.) These files are created in the directory from which Replmerg.exe was invoked. For security, you should delete these files after you are finished.
