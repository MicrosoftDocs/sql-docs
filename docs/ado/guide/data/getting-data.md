# Getting Data
[ADO Fundamentals](../../../ado/guide/data/ado-fundamentals.md), and the [HelloData](../../../ado/guide/data/hellodata-a-simple-ado-application.md) example in particular, introduced the four primary operations involved in creating an ADO application: getting data, examining data, editing data, and updating data. This section discusses getting data in more detail.  
  
 On a basic level, several ADO objects contribute to the operations of getting data. First you must connect to a data source using an ADO **Connection** object. Then you pass instructions to the data source using an ADO **Command** object. Finally, you most often receive data in an ADO **Recordset** object.  
  
 This section contains the following topics.  
  
-   [Connecting to Data Sources](../../../ado/guide/data/connecting-to-data-sources.md)  
  
-   [Preparing and Executing Commands](../../../ado/guide/data/preparing-and-executing-commands.md)  
  
-   [Receiving Results](../../../ado/guide/data/receiving-results.md)
