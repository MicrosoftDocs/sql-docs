# Create a Basic Table Report (SSRS Tutorial)

In this tutorial, you use Report Designer in SQL Server Data Tools to create a basic [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion_md](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] paginated report with a table, based on the **[!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBAdventureworks2014_md](../includes/sssampledbadventureworks2014-md.md)]** database. You can also create [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion_md](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] paginated reports with Report Builder. 

As you go through this tutorial, you will create a report project, set up connection information, define a query, add a Table data region, group and total some fields, and preview the report.  
  
## Requirements  
Your system must have the following installed to use this tutorial:  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] SQL Server database engine.  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssRSCurrent](../includes/ssrscurrent-md.md)] in native mode.  
  
-   The [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBAdventureworks2014_md](../includes/sssampledbadventureworks2014-md.md)] database.  For more information, see [Adventure Works 2014 Sample Databases)](https://msftdbprodsamples.codeplex.com/releases/view/125550).  
  
 -   [SQL Server Data Tools](/sql-docs/docs/ssdt/download-sql-server-data-tools-ssdt) with the "SQL Server Reporting Services" components installed so you have the Report Designer.    
  
You must also have read-only permissions to retrieve data from the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBAdventureworks2014_md](../includes/sssampledbadventureworks2014-md.md)] database.

**Estimated time to complete the tutorial:** 30 minutes.
