# Password Expired
Appears when you connect to a server with [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull_md.md)] using [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Authentication, and the password you provided is correct but has expired. Also appears when you connect to a server with a new account that is created by using the **User must change password at next logon** option.
