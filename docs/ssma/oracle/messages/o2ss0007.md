# O2SS0007: Check constraint condition not parsed (Error)

This article covers the reason why SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Oracle is not able to convert a `BINARY_FLOAT` column with a constraint for checking a `NAN` (Not a Number) condition.

## Background

In Oracle, the `BINARY_FLOAT` data type allows an application to store number underflow or overflow values. SQL Server generates an error as soon as a number overflow or underflow is computed and thus can't store the value in a `FLOAT` data type. When you try to convert the schema of a table having a constraint condition which is checking for `NAN` values, SSMA generates an error because SQL Server doesn't support floating point conditions like `NAN`.

## Example

Consider the below example where we have created a table and altered it by adding a constraint of `NAN` type:

```sql
CREATE TABLE NANTEST
(
    COL1 BINARY_FLOAT
);
/

ALTER TABLE NANTEST ADD CONSTRAINT NANCHECK1 CHECK (COL1 IS NOT NAN);
```

When you try to convert the schema of the above table in SSMA, it generates the following error message:

> O2SS0007: Check constraint condition not parsed

## Possible remedies

The solution to the example above can be divided into 2 steps:

**Step 1:** Create a new table in SQL Server without the check constraint:

```sql
CREATE TABLE NANTEST
(
    COL1 FLOAT(53)
)
```

Equivalent of `BINARY_FLOAT` in SQL Server is `FLOAT(53)`.

**Step 2:** Modify the application code for inserting the values in this table. Create a `TRY .. CATCH` block which will prevent users from inserting an unsupported value and generate an error message similar to an error generated from a check constraint:

```sql
DECLARE
    @VAL FLOAT(53)

BEGIN TRY
    SET @VAL = 1 / 0

    INSERT INTO NANTEST VALUES (@VAL)
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    PRINT(
        'SQL error is ' + CONVERT(varchar(20), ERROR_NUMBER())
            + ' : ' + CONVERT(varchar(100), ERROR_MESSAGE()))
END CATCH;
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Trying to use `ISNUMERIC()` function in a check constraint for this scenario is not a viable solution, because `ISNUMERIC()` is designed to check for strings that might represent numeric values and not numeric underflow and overflow conditions.
