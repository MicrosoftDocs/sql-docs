 > For content related to previous versions of SQL Server, see [SQL Server Integration Services](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/ms141026(SQL.120).aspx).

[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] is a platform for building enterprise-level data integration and data transformations solutions. You use [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] to solve complex business problems by copying or downloading files, sending e-mail messages in response to events, updating data warehouses, cleaning and mining data, and managing [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] objects and data. The packages can work alone or in concert with other packages to address complex business needs. [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] can extract and transform data from a wide variety of sources such as XML data files, flat files, and relational data sources, and then load the data into one or more destinations.<br /><br /> [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] includes a rich set of built-in tasks and transformations; tools for constructing packages; and the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] service for running and managing packages. You can use the graphical [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] tools to create solutions without writing a single line of code; or you can program the extensive [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] object model to create packages programmatically and code custom tasks and other package objects.
