## SQL Server Technologies    
    
|||    
|-|-|    
|![SQL database engine](../sql-server/media/sql-database-engine.png "SQL database engine")|**[Database Engine](../database-engine/configure-windows/sql-server-database-engine.md)**<br /><br /> The Database Engine is the core service for storing, processing, and securing data. The Database Engine provides controlled access and rapid transaction processing to meet the requirements of the most demanding data consuming applications within your enterprise. The Database Engine also provides rich support for sustaining high availability.|
|![Integration Services](../sql-server/media/integration-services.png "Integration Services")|**[Integration Services](../integration-services/sql-server-integration-services.md)**<br /><br /> [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] is a platform for building high performance data integration solutions, including packages that provide extract, transform, and load (ETL) processing for data warehousing.|    
|![Analysis Services](../sql-server/media/analysis-services.png "Analysis Services")|**[Analysis Services](../analysis-services/analysis-services.md)**<br /><br /> [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion_md](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] is an analytical data platform and toolset for personal, team, and corporate business intelligence. Servers and client designers support traditional OLAP solutions, new tabular modeling solutions, as well as self-service analytics and collaboration using [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../includes/ssgemini-md.md)], Excel, and a SharePoint Server environment. [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] also includes Data Mining so that you can uncover the patterns and relationships hidden inside large volumes of data.|    
|![Reporting Services](../sql-server/media/reporting-services.png "Reporting Services")|**[Reporting Services](../reporting-services/create-deploy-and-manage-mobile-and-paginated-reports.md)**<br /><br /> Reporting Services delivers enterprise, Web-enabled reporting functionality.  You can create reports that draw content from a variety of data sources, publish reports in various formats, and centrally manage security and subscriptions.|
|![R Server](../sql-server/media/r-server.png "R Server")|**[Machine Learning Services](../advanced-analytics/r-services/r-services.md)**<br /><br /> Microsoft Machine Learning Services supports integration of machine learning, using the popular R and Python languages, into enterprise workflows.<br /><br /> Machine Learning Services (In-Database) integrates R and Python with SQL Server, making it easy to build, retrain, and score models by calling stored procedures.  Microsoft Machine Learning Server provides enterprise-scale support for R and Python, without requiring SQL Server.|
|![Data Quality Services](../sql-server/media/data-quality-services.png "Data Quality Services")|**[Data Quality Services](../data-quality-services/data-quality-services.md)**<br /><br /> SQL Server Data Quality Services (DQS) provides you with a knowledge-driven data cleansing solution. DQS enables you to build a knowledge base, and then use that knowledge base to perform data correction and deduplication on your data, using both computer-assisted and interactive means. You can use cloud-based reference data services, and you can build a data management solution that integrates DQS with SQL Server Integration Services and Master Data Services.|
|![Replication services](../sql-server/media/replication-services.png "Replication services")|**[Replication](../relational-databases/replication/sql-server-replication.md)**<br /><br /> Replication is a set of technologies for copying and distributing data and database objects from one database to another, and then synchronizing between databases to maintain consistency. By using replication, you can distribute data to different locations and to remote or mobile users by means of local and wide area networks, dial-up connections, wireless connections, and the Internet.|
|![Master Data Services](../sql-server/media/master-data-services.png)|**[Master Data Services](../master-data-services/master-data-services-installation-and-configuration.md)**<br /><br /> [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] is the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] solution for master data management. A solution built on [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)] helps ensure that reporting and analysis is based on the right information. Using [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)], you create a central repository for your master data and maintain an auditable, securable record of that data as it changes over time.|
