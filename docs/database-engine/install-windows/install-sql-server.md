# SQL Server installation guide

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server - Windows Only](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-windows-only.md)]

This article is an index of content that provides guidance for installing [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on Windows.

For other deployment scenarios, see:

- [Linux](../../linux/sql-server-linux-setup.md)
- [Docker containers](../../linux/sql-server-linux-docker-container-deployment.md)
- [Kubernetes - Big Data Clusters](../../big-data-cluster/deploy-get-started.md) ([!INCLUDE [sssql19-md](../../includes/sssql19-md.md)] only)

Beginning with [!INCLUDE[sssql16-md](../../includes/sssql16-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is only available as a 64-bit application. Here are important details about how to get [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and how to install it.

## Get started

- **Editions and features**: Review the supported features for the different editions and versions of [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to determine which best suits your business needs.

  - [[!INCLUDE[sssql22-md](../../includes/sssql22-md.md)]](../../sql-server/editions-and-components-of-sql-server-2022.md)
  - [[!INCLUDE[sssql19-md](../../includes/sssql19-md.md)]](../../sql-server/editions-and-components-of-sql-server-2019.md)
  - [[!INCLUDE[sssql17-md](../../includes/sssql17-md.md)]](../../sql-server/editions-and-components-of-sql-server-2017.md)
  - [[!INCLUDE[sssql16-md](../../includes/sssql16-md.md)]](../../sql-server/editions-and-components-of-sql-server-2016.md)
  - [[!INCLUDE[ss2014](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)]](/previous-versions/sql/2014/getting-started/features-supported-by-the-editions-of-sql-server-2014)

- **Requirements**: Review hardware and software installation requirements for [SQL Server 2016 and SQL Server 2017](../../sql-server/install/hardware-and-software-requirements-for-installing-sql-server.md), [SQL Server 2019](../../sql-server/install/hardware-and-software-requirements-for-installing-sql-server.md), [SQL Server 2022](../../sql-server/install/hardware-and-software-requirements-for-installing-sql-server.md), or [SQL Server on Linux](../../linux/sql-server-linux-setup.md), as well as system configuration checks, and security considerations in [Planning a SQL Server Installation](../../sql-server/install/planning-a-sql-server-installation.md)

- **Sample databases and sample code** aren't installed as part of [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup by default, but can be installed for non-Express editions of [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. For more information, see [Microsoft SQL samples](../../samples/sql-samples-where-are.md).

## Installation media

The download location for [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] depends on the edition:

- **[!INCLUDE[ssnoversion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Enterprise, Standard, and Express editions** are licensed for production use. For the Enterprise and Standard Editions, contact your software vendor for the installation media. You can find purchasing information and a directory of Microsoft partners on the [Microsoft licensing page](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/product-licensing/sql-server).
- If you have a volume licensing agreement, for example an [Enterprise Agreement](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/licensing-programs/enterprise), you can download software from the [Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC)](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx).
- [Free versions](https://www.microsoft.com/sql-server/sql-server-downloads).

Other [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] components can be found here:

- [All cumulative updates](https://sqlserverbuilds.blogspot.com/)
- [All cumulative updates new](https://sdpincode.com/)
- [SQL Server Reporting Services](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=104502).
- [SQL Server Management Studio](https://aka.ms/ssmsfullsetup)
- [Azure Data Studio](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109256)

## Considerations

- Installation fails if you launch setup through Remote Desktop Connection with the media on a local resource in the RDC client. To install remotely the media must be on a network share or local to the physical or virtual machine. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] installation media may be either on a network share, a mapped drive, a local drive, or presented as an ISO to a virtual machine.

- [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup installs the following software components required by the product:

  - [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client
  - [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup support files
