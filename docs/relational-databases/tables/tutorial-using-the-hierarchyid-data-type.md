# Tutorial: Using the hierarchyid Data Type
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]
This tutorial is intended for users who are experienced with [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)], but are new to the **hierarchyid** data type.  
  
## What You Will Learn  
This tutorial is divided into two lessons:  
  
[Lesson 1: Converting a Table to a Hierarchical Structure](../../relational-databases/tables/lesson-1-converting-a-table-to-a-hierarchical-structure.md)  
In this lesson, you take an existing employee table that is structured as a parent/child hierarchy and move the data into a new table that represents the hierarchy by using the **hierarchyid** data type. This lesson requires the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBobject](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] sample database.  
  
[Lesson 2: Creating and Managing Data in a Hierarchical Table](../../relational-databases/tables/lesson-2-creating-and-managing-data-in-a-hierarchical-table.md)  
In this lesson, you create a table by using the **hierarchyid** data type to represent the hierarchy structure. Then, you manipulate the data in the table by using the hierarchical methods.  
  
## Requirements  
Your system must have the following installed:  
  
-   Any edition of [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)] or later.  
  
-   Either [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)] Express.  
  
-   Internet Explorer 6 or a later version.
