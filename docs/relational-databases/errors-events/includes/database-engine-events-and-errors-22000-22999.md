|    22511    |    16    |    No    |    The merge completed successfully.    |
|    22512    |    16    |    No    |    Cannot use partition groups with unfiltered publications. Set "use_partition_groups" to "false" using sp_changemergepublication.    |
|    22513    |    16    |    No    |    Cannot use partition groups because the join filter between the following articles contains one or more functions: "%s" and "%s".    |
|    22514    |    16    |    No    |    Cannot use partition groups because one or more filters reference the following view, which contains functions: "%s".    |
|    22515    |    16    |    No    |    The publication cannot use precomputed partitions because there is at least one circular reference in the join filters specified for the articles in the publication. To use precomputed partitions, ensure that no circular join filter relationships exist.    |
|    22516    |    16    |    No    |    The publication "%s" was defined as having dynamic filters, but it does not contain any dynamic filters.    |
|    22517    |    16    |    No    |    The publication was defined as having no dynamic filters, but contains one or more dynamic filters.    |

|    22520    |    10    |    No    |    A filtering type changed for the article. Any pending or future changes made in this article by a Subscriber in a given partition will no longer be propagated to Subscribers in other partitions. Check the documentation for details.    |
|    22521    |    10    |    No    |    Unable to synchronize the row because the row was updated by a different process outside of replication.    |
|    22522    |    16    |    No    |    Article '%s' cannot be published because it is published in another merge publication. An article that has a value of 3 for the \@partition_options parameter of sp_addmergearticle (nonoverlapping partitions with a single subscription per partition) cannot be included in multiple publications or subscriptions, and cannot be republished. To include the article in multiple publications, use sp_changemergearticle to specify a different value for the partition_options property of the existing article.    |
|    22523    |    16    |    No    |    An article cannot use \@partition_options 2 or 3 (nonoverlapping partitions) and be a part of a logical record relationship at the same time. Check article "%s".    |

The specified value must be the same in all merge publications. Either specify the same value as the existing article or change the existing article using sp_changemergearticle.    |
|    22525    |    16    |    No    |    The publication "%s" cannot allow multiple subscriptions per partition if it contains articles using \@partition_options = 3.    |
|    22526    |    16    |    No    |    An invalid value was specified for %s. Valid values are 0 (none), 1 (enforced partitions), 2 (nonoverlapping partitions with multiple subscriptions per partition), and 3 (nonoverlapping partitions with single subscription per partition).    |
|    22527    |    16    |    No    |    Invalid value specified for %s. Valid values are 'day', 'days', 'dd', 'year', 'years', 'yy', 'yyyy', 'month', 'months', 'mm', 'week', 'weeks', 'wk', 'hour', 'hours', 'hh', 'minute', 'minutes', 'mi'.    |
|    22528    |    16    |    No    |    Cannot use a retention period unit other than "days" for publication "%s" because the compatibility level of the publication is lower than 90. Use sp_changemergepublication to set publication_compatibility_level to 90RTM.    |
|    22529    |    16    |    No    |    Cannot change the retention period unit for publication "%s" because the compatibility level of the publication is lower than 90. Use sp_changemergepublication to set publication_compatibility_level to 90RTM.    |
|    22530    |    16    |    No    |    Cannot update any column in article "%s" that is used in a logical record relationship clause.    |
|    22531    |    10    |    No    |    Initialization.    |
|    22532    |    10    |    No    |    Upload of Subscriber changes to the Publisher.    |

|    22534    |    16    |    No    |    Character mode publication does not support partitioned tables.    |
|    22535    |    16    |    No    |    For heterogeneous publications, the %s parameters should be specified when calling "%s".    |
|    22536    |    16    |    No    |    The %s parameter value cannot be updated or changed for heterogeneous publications.    |
|    22537    |    16    |    No    |    The job_login provided must match the Publisher login specified when adding the distribution Publisher (sp_adddistpublisher).    |
|    22538    |    16    |    No    |    Only replication jobs or job schedules can be added, modified, dropped or viewed through replication stored procedures.    |
|    22539    |    16    |    No    |    Use of parameters %s is invalid when parameter %s is set to %s.    |
|    22540    |    16    |    No    |    Cannot change publication "%s" to use sync_mode of "character", because it contains one or more logical record relationships.    |
|    22541    |    16    |    No    |    Cannot add a logical record relationship in publication "%s" because it uses sync_mode of "character" and could have SQL Server Compact Edition subscribers.    |
|    22542    |    16    |    No    |    Invalid value for property \@subscriber_upload_options. Valid values are 0 (allow uploads), 1 (disable uploads), 2 (disable uploads prohibit subscriber changes), and 3 (disable_outofpartition_subscriber_changes).    |
|    22543    |    16    |    No    |    When the publication property \@allow_partition_realignment is set to "false", the article property \@subscriber_upload_options for all articles in the publication must be set to disable uploads.    |
|    22544    |    10    |    No    |    Warning: The procedure sp_mergecleanupmetadata has been deprecated. In SQL Server 2000 SP1 and later, the merge agent calls sp_mergemetadataretentioncleanup every time it runs, so manual cleanup of metadata is not needed. Ignoring passed-in parameters and calling sp_mergemetadataretentioncleanup.    |
|    22545    |    16    |    No    |    Cannot add a logical record relationship in publication "%s" because it allows Web synchronization.    |
|    22546    |    16    |    No    |    Cannot change publication "%s" to allow Web synchronization because it contains one or more logical record relationships.    |
|    22547    |    16    |    No    |    A concurrent snapshot is not allowed for snapshot publications.    |
|    22548    |    16    |    No    |    Vertical partitioning is only allowed for log-based articles.    |
|    22549    |    16    |    No    |    A shared distribution agent (%s) already exists for this subscription.    |
|    22550    |    16    |    No    |    Cannot drop identity column "%s" from the vertical partition when identityrangemanagementoption is set to auto.    |
|    22551    |    16    |    No    |    The type "%s" is invalid. Valid types are "merge", "tran", and "both".    |
|    22552    |    16    |    No    |    A valid value for parameter "\@resync_date_str" needs to be provided when "\@resync_type" is set to 2.    |
|    22553    |    16    |    No    |    The parameter "\@resync_type" is set to "%d" but this subscription has never been successfully validated.    |
|    22554    |    16    |    No    |    Cannot change publication "%s" to use the sync_mode of "character" because it uses a retention period unit other than "day". Use sp_changemergepublication to set the retention period unit to "day".    |
|    22555    |    16    |    No    |    Cannot set the retention period unit to a value other than "day" for publication "%s" because it uses the sync_mode of "character" and may have SQL Server Compact Edition subscribers.    |
|    22556    |    16    |    No    |    Invalid value for the property "%s". Valid values are 1 and 0.    |
|    22557    |    16    |    No    |    The status of the schema change could not be updated because the publication compatibility level is less than 90. Use sp_changemergepublication to set the publication_compatibility_level of publication "%s" to 90RTM.    |
|    22558    |    16    |    No    |    The status of the schema change could not be updated.    |
|    22559    |    16    |    No    |    The status of the schema change must be "active" or "skipped".    |
|    22560    |    16    |    No    |    Merge replication does not allow filters that reference dynamic functions that take one or more parameters. Check the function "%s".    |
|    22561    |    16    |    No    |    The requested operation failed because the publication compatibility level is less than 90. Use sp_changemergepublication to set the publication_compatibility_level of publication "%s" to 90RTM.    |
|    22562    |    16    |    No    |    Cannot change the compatibility level of a publication to a value lower than the existing value.    |

|    22575    |    16    |    No    |    When article property 'published_in_tran_pub' is set to 'true' then article property 'upload_options' has to be set to disable uploads.    |
|    22576    |    10    |    No    |    Invalid failover_mode value of %d was specified for [%s].[%s].[%s], setting to 0 [immediate].    |
|    22577    |    16    |    No    |    Failed to add subscription because the allowed number of %s subscriptions for SQL Workgroup Edition Publisher '%s' would be exceeded. The maximum allowed number is %d.    |
|    22578    |    16    |    No    |    Cannot change publication "%s" to disallow use_partition_groups because it contains one or more logical record relationships. When using logical record relationships the publication must set the \@use_partition_groups property to 'true'.    |
|    22579    |    16    |    No    |    The subscription to publication '%s' was not found but a shared agent does exist. To specify a subscription to a publication that is replicated via a shared agent specify '%s' for the publication name.    |
|    22580    |    16    |    No    |    Cannot publish database '%s' because it is marked as published on a different server. Before attempting to publish this database, execute sp_replicationdboption, specifying a value of FALSE for 'publish' and 'merge publish'.    |
|    22581    |    16    |    No    |    Article '%s' cannot be added or modified in publication '%s'. The replication of FILESTREAM columns is not supported for publications that have a 'sync_mode' of 1 (character mode). Specify a 'sync_mode' of 0 (native mode) for the publication by using sp_addmergepublication or sp_changemergepublication, or partition the article vertically so that the FILESTREAM column is not replicated.    |
|    22582    |    16    |    No    |    Article '%s' cannot be added or modified in publication '%s'. The replication of FILESTREAM columns is not supported for publications that have a 'publication_compatibility_level' of less than "90RTM" (SQL Server 2005). Specify a 'publication_compatibility_level' greater than or equal to "90RTM" by using sp_addmergepublication or sp_changemergepublication, or partition the article vertically so that the FILESTREAM column is not replicated.    |
|    22583    |    16    |    No    |    Article '%s' cannot be added or modified in publication '%s'. The replication of FILESTREAM columns is not supported for articles that have a 'schema_option' set to 0x20000000. This converts large object data types to data types that are supported on earlier versions of Microsoft SQL Server. Remove this 'schema_option' setting by using sp_addmergepublication or sp_changemergepublication, or partition the article vertically so that the FILESTREAM column is not replicated.    |
|    22584    |    10    |    No    |    Warning: Values of some of the flags specified in the 'schema_option' property are not compatible with the publication's compatibility level. The modified schema_option value of '%s' will be used instead.    |
|    22585    |    10    |    No    |    The schema option to script out the FILESTREAM attribute on varbinary(max) columns has been enabled for article '%s'. Enabling this option after the article is created can cause replication to fail when the data in a FILESTREAM column exceeds 2GB and there is a conflict during replication. If you want FILESTREAM data to be replicated, drop and re-create the article, and specify the appropriate schema option when you re-create the article.    |
|    22586    |    16    |    No    |    Column '%s' cannot be added or modified in article '%s' of publication '%s'. The DDL operatoin on hierarchyid and FILESTREAM columns is not supported for publications that have a 'sync_mode' of 1 (character mode) or with a lower than 90RTM backward compatibility level.    |

|    22806    |    16    |    No    |    The originator ID '%s' is not valid. You must specify a non-zero ID that has never been used in the topology.    |
|    22807    |    16    |    No    |    The publication property '%s' cannot be modified because the peer-to-peer publication '%s' is not enabled for conflict detection. To enable the publication for conflict detection, use sp_configure_peerconflictdetection.    |
|    22808    |    16    |    No    |    Cannot execute procedure '%s'. Publication '%s' must be enabled for peer-to-peer replication before you execute this procedure. To enable the publication for peer-to-peer replication, use sp_changepublication.    |
|    22809    |    10    |    No    |    The existing conflict table '%s' was dropped.    |
|    22810    |    16    |    No    |    The \@action parameter value is not valid. Valid values are 'enable' and 'disable'.    |
|    22811    |    16    |    No    |    The roundtrip time-out must be greater than 0.    |
|    22812    |    10    |    No    |    The roundtrip '%s' finished with timeout: %d seconds.    |
