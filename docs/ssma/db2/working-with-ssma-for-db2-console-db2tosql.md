# Work with SSMA for DB2 Console (DB2ToSQL)

[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Migration Assistant (SSMA) release for DB2 is now accessible through a console application at command line. The script files form the input to the application for executing the commands. As a console application, SSMA enables script-level interfacing, reduces the migration cycle, and scales the migration effort.

This section explains the procedure to migrate the DB2 database using the SSMA Console application.
