# Setting DCOM Stream Marshaling Format
A client computer using components from RDS 1.5 or earlier is not compatible with a server using components from RDS 2.0 or later. When using DCOM as the underlying protocol, the support for RDS 2.0 or later is more efficient in transporting [Recordset](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/recordset-object-ado.md) objects. If your client is running components from RDS 1.5 or earlier, you can set your server to work with the previous RDS support (called RDS 1.0) or the newer RDS support (called RDS 2.0 or later). Set either of the following registry entries:  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Beginning with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, RDS server components are no longer included in the Windows operating system (see Windows 8 and [Windows Server 2012 Compatibility Cookbook](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=27416) for more detail). RDS client components will be removed in a future version of Windows. Avoid using this feature in new development work, and plan to modify applications that currently use this feature. Applications that use RDS should migrate to [WCF Data Service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=199565).
