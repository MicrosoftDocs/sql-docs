# sysmail_event_log (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Contains one row for each Windows or [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] message returned by the Database Mail system. (Message in this context refers to a message such as an error message, not an e-mail message.) Configure the **Logging Level** parameter by using the **Configure System Parameters** dialog box of the Database Mail Configuration Wizard, or the [sysmail_configure_sp](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sysmail-configure-sp-transact-sql.md) stored procedure, to determine which messages are returned.  
  
|Column name|Data type|Description|  
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|  
|**Log_id**|**int**|Identifier of items in the log.|  
|**event_type**|**varchar(11)**|The type of notice inserted in the log. Possible values are errors, warnings, informational messages, success messages, and additional internal messages.|  
|**log_date**|**datetime**|The date and time the log entry is made.|  
|**description**|**nvarchar(max)**|The text of the message being recorded.|  
|**process_id**|**int**|The process id of the Database Mail external program. This typically changes each time the Database Mail external program starts.|  
|**mailitem_id**|**int**|Identifier of the mail item in the mail queue. NULL if the message is not related to a specific e-mail item.|  
|**account_id**|**int**|The **account_id** of the account related to the event. NULL if the message is not related to a specific account.|  
|**last_mod_date**|**datetime**|The date and time of the last modification of the row.|  
|**last_mod_user**|**sysname**|The user who last modified the row. For e-mails, this is the user who sent the mail. For messages generated by the Database Mail external program, this is the user context of the program.|  
  
## Remarks  
 When troubleshooting Database Mail, search the **sysmail_event_log** view for events related to e-mail failures. Some messages, such as the failure of the Database Mail external program, are not associated with specific e-mails. To search for errors related to specific e-mails, look up the **mailitem_id** of the failed e-mail in the **sysmail_faileditems** view and then search the **sysmail_event_log** for messages related to that **mailitem_id**. When an error is returned from **sp_send_dbmail**, the e-mail is not submitted to the Database Mail system and the error is not displayed in this view.  
  
 When individual account delivery attempts fail, Database Mail holds the error messages during retry attempts until the mail item delivery either succeeds or fails. In case of ultimate success, all of the accumulated errors get logged as separate warnings including the **account_id**. This can cause warnings to appear, even though the e-mail was sent. In case of ultimate delivery failure, all previous warnings get logged as one error message without an **account_id**, since all accounts have failed.  
  
## Permissions  
 You must be a member of the **sysadmin** fixed server role or the **DatabaseMailUserRole** database role to access this view. Members of **DatabaseMailUserRole** who are not members of the **sysadmin** role, can only see the events for e-mails that they submit.
