# Conclusion
  In this tutorial, you have learned how to use SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), Master Data Services (MDS), and Data Quality Services (DQS) together to implement a sample Enterprise Information Management (EIM) solution. First, you used the Data Quality Client tool to create a DQS knowledge base with the knowledge about suppliers, cleansed the input supplier data in an excel file against the knowledge base, and then matched the supplier data by using a matching policy in the knowledge base to identify and remove duplicates in the data. Next, by using the MDS Add-in for Excel, you stored the cleansed and matched supplier list in MDS. Finally, you automated the whole process of receiving input data, cleansing and matching the data, and storing the master data in MDS by creating an SSIS solution.
