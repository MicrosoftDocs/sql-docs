# Change the Default Location for Projects
  The default location for files and projects is the [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] Projects folder in your My Documents folder.  
  
### To change the default location for projects  
  
1.  Change the default location by opening or saving a file or project from another location. [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] stores the location of the previously opened project and uses it for the next opening or saving of a project.
