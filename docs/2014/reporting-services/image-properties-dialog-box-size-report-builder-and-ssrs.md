# Image Properties Dialog Box, Size (Report Builder and SSRS)
  Select **Size** on the **Image Properties** dialog box to format the size of the images displayed in a field or in the design area, or to change the amount of extra space between the edge of a cell or text box and the picture or value contained within the cell or text box.  
  
## Options  
 **Original Size**  
 If this option is selected and the image appears in a field, the field size adjusts to accommodate the largest image in the entire set. If this option is selected and the image appears in the design area, the image appears as its original size.  
  
 **Fit to size**  
 Choose this option to adjust the image size to fit the height and width of the cell or text box.  
  
 **Fit proportional**  
 Choose this option to adjust the image size to proportionally fit the height and width of the cell or text box.  
  
 **Clip**  
 Choose this option to display an image from the top left corner of the picture to the height and width of the cell or text box. The borders of the image can shrink or grow to fit the image. If the image is larger than the cell or text box, only a portion of the image is displayed.  
  
 **Left**  
 Specify how much padding, or space, there is between the left edge of a cell or text box and the value displayed within the cell.  
  
 **Right**  
 Specify how much padding, or space, there is between the right edge of a cell or text box and the value displayed within the cell.  
  
 **Top**  
 Specify how much padding, or space, there is between the right edge of a cell or text box and the value displayed within the cell.  
  
 **Bottom**  
 Specify how much padding, or space, there is between the right edge of a cell or text box and the value displayed within the cell.
