# REVOKE Search Property List Permissions (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Revokes permissions on a search property list.  
  
 ![Topic link icon](../../database-engine/configure-windows/media/topic-link.gif "Topic link icon") [Transact-SQL Syntax Conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
REVOKE [ GRANT OPTION FOR ] permission [ ,...n ] ON  
        SEARCH PROPERTY LIST :: search_property_list_name  
    { TO | FROM } database_principal [ ,...n ]  
    [ CASCADE ]  
    [ AS revoking_principal ]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 GRANT OPTION FOR  
 Indicates that the right to grant the specified permission to other principals will be revoked. The permission itself will not be revoked.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  If the principal has the specified permission without the GRANT option, the permission itself will be revoked.  
  
 *permission*  
 Is the name of a permission. The valid mappings of permissions to securables are described in the "Remarks" section, later in this topic.  
  
 ON SEARCH PROPERTY LIST **::**_search_property_list_name_  
 Specifies the search property list on which the permission is being revoked. The scope qualifier **::** is required.  
  
 *database_principal*  
 Specifies the principal from which the permission is being revoked. The principal can be one of the following:  
  
-   database user  
  
-   database role  
  
-   application role  
  
-   database user mapped to a Windows login  
  
-   database user mapped to a Windows group  
  
-   database user mapped to a certificate  
  
-   database user mapped to an asymmetric key  
  
-   database user not mapped to a server principal.  
  
 CASCADE  
 Indicates that the permission being revoked is also revoked from other principals to which it has been granted by this principal.  
  
> [!CAUTION]  
>  A cascaded revocation of a permission granted WITH GRANT OPTION will revoke both GRANT and DENY of that permission.  
  
 AS *revoking_principal*  
 Specifies a principal from which the principal executing this query derives its right to revoke the permission. The principal can be one of the following:  
  
-   database user  
  
-   database role  
  
-   application role  
  
-   database user mapped to a Windows login  
  
-   database user mapped to a Windows group  
  
-   database user mapped to a certificate  
  
-   database user mapped to an asymmetric key  
  
-   database user not mapped to a server principal.  
  
## Remarks  
  
## SEARCH PROPERTY LIST Permissions  
 A search property list is a database-level securable contained by the database that is its parent in the permissions hierarchy. The most specific and limited permissions that can be revoked on a search property list are listed in the following, together with the more general permissions that include them by implication.  
  
|Search property list permission|Implied by search property list permission|Implied by database permission|  
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|  
|ALTER|CONTROL|ALTER ANY FULLTEXT CATALOG|  
|CONTROL|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|REFERENCES|CONTROL|REFERENCES|  
|TAKE OWNERSHIP|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|VIEW DEFINITION|CONTROL|VIEW DEFINITION|  
  
## Permissions  
 Requires CONTROL permission on the full-text catalog.
