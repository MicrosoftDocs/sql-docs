# SMO Programming - Getting Started in Visual Basic .NET
  [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Visual Basic .NET in one of the managed programming languages that is supported by the common runtime library in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] .NET. Many of the samples in this documentation are written in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] .NET. You can use [!INCLUDE[vsprvslong](../../includes/vsprvslong-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vsOrcas](../../includes/vsorcas-md.md)] to develop SMO applications.  
  
## References and Imports  
 After you have started the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] project, you must add references to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Management Objects (SMO) assemblies. Then, import the required namespaces so that your program can recognize the SMO types.  
  
 In [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)], the SMO assemblies are located in the C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\130\SDK\Assemblies\ folder.
