# Maintenance Plan (Manage Connections)
  Use the **Manage Connections** dialog box to specify the properties of connections used by maintenance plans. When you create a maintenance plan, a local connection to the server where you created the plan is created. Use this connection to create tasks that perform work on this local connection. When needed, use the **Manage Connections** dialog box to add them. When additional connections are configured they appear in the connections box for each task.  
  
## Options  
 **Server**  
 The server instance.  
  
 **Authentication**  
 Indicates whether the connection is made with Windows Authentication or [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication.
