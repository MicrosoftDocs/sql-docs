 **Edit**  
 Use the **Connection Manager** dialog box to create a connection to a server that is running an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)], and to edit connection properties.  
  
 **Create a connection to an Analysis Services project in this solution**  
 Specify that the connection will use an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] project in the open solution.
