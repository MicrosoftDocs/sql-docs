# Changes to behavior of string-length and substring
  The [string-length Function &#40;XQuery&#41;](/sql/xquery/functions-on-string-values-string-length) and [substring Function &#40;XQuery&#41;](/sql/xquery/functions-on-string-values-substring) functions may return different results when used with XML databases that contain surrogate characters.  
  
## Description  
 When a database is set to be compatible with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)], the behavior of the [string-length Function &#40;XQuery&#41;](/sql/xquery/functions-on-string-values-string-length) and [substring Function &#40;XQuery&#41;](/sql/xquery/functions-on-string-values-substring) functions changes when dealing with Unicode supplementary characters. Each Unicode supplementary character, which is defined by having a code point larger than U+FFFF, is counted as one character by these functions rather than two, as it was in previous versions.  
  
 For more information about surrogate characters, see [Surrogates and Supplementary Characters](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=178317).
