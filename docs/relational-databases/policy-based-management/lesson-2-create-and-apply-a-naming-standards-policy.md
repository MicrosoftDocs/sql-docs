# Lesson 2: Create and Apply a Naming Standards Policy
Some types of Policy-Based Management policies can create triggers to enforce future compliance with the policy. In this lesson, you create a policy that enforces a naming standard for tables. Then, you test the policy by trying to create a table that violates the policy.  
  
This lesson contains the following topics:  
  
-   [Create the Finance Name Policy](../../relational-databases/policy-based-management/lesson-2-1-create-the-finance-name-policy.md)  
  
-   [Subscribe to and Check the Finance Name Policy](../../relational-databases/policy-based-management/lesson-2-2-subscribe-to-and-check-the-finance-name-policy.md)  
  
## Next Task in Lesson  
[Create the Finance Name Policy](../../relational-databases/policy-based-management/lesson-2-1-create-the-finance-name-policy.md)
