# Lesson 4: Defining Advanced Attribute and Dimension Properties
  In this lesson, you will learn how to use some of the advanced properties of attributes, attribute hierarchies, and dimension properties.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  This lesson is based on an enhanced version of the [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] Tutorial project that you completed in the first three lessons of this tutorial. The first task in this lesson describes where to locate the appropriate sample project to use for the lesson, and the difference between this project and the project that you created in the first three lessons.  
  
 This lesson contains the following tasks:  
  
 [Using a Modified Version of the Analysis Services Tutorial Project](lesson-4-1-using-a-modified-version-of-the-analysis-services-tutorial-project.md)  
 In this task, you open, review, and deploy a modified version of the [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] Tutorial project, which has multiple measure groups and additional dimensions.  
  
 [Defining Parent Attribute Properties in a Parent-Child Hierarchy](lesson-4-2-defining-parent-attribute-properties-in-a-parent-child-hierarchy.md)  
 In this task, you define level names in a parent-child dimension and specify whether data related to parent members is displayed. For more information, see [Parent-Child Hierarchy](multidimensional-models/parent-child-dimension.md) and [Attributes in Parent-Child Hierarchies](multidimensional-models/parent-child-dimension-attributes.md).  
  
 [Automatically Grouping Attribute Members](lesson-4-3-automatically-grouping-attribute-members.md)  
 In this task, you automatically create groupings of attribute members based on the distribution of the members within the attribute hierarchy. For more information, see [Group Attribute Members &#40;Discretization&#41;](multidimensional-models/attribute-properties-group-attribute-members.md).  
  
 [Hiding and Disabling Attribute Hierarchies](../analysis-services/lesson-4-4-hiding-and-disabling-attribute-hierarchies.md)  
 In this task, you learn how and when to disable or hide attribute hierarchies.  
  
 [Sorting Attribute Members Based on a Secondary Attribute](lesson-4-5-sorting-attribute-members-based-on-a-secondary-attribute.md)  
 In this task, you learn how to sort dimension members based on a secondary attribute, to achieve the sort order that you want.  
  
 [Specifying Attribute Relationships Between Attributes in a User-Defined Hierarchy](4-6-specifying-attribute-relationships-in-user-defined-hierarchy.md)  
 In this task, you learn how to define member properties for attributes and to specify aggregation relationships between them. For more information, see [Define Attribute Relationships](multidimensional-models/attribute-relationships-define.md) and [User Hierarchy Properties](multidimensional-models-olap-logical-dimension-objects/user-hierarchies-properties.md).  
  
 [Defining the Unknown Member and Null Processing Properties](lesson-4-7-defining-the-unknown-member-and-null-processing-properties.md)  
 In this task, you configure the UnknownMember and UnknownMemberName properties to handle error conditions caused by null dimension members.
