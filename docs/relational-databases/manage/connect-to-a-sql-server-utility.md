# Connect to a SQL Server Utility
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
  Before you can connect to a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Utility, you must create a utility control point (UCP). For more information, see [SQL Server Utility Features and Tasks](../../relational-databases/manage/sql-server-utility-features-and-tasks.md).  
  
 To view and manage [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] resource health, use [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] (SSMS) to connect to a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Utility.  
  
 To connect to a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Utility through SSMS:  
  
1.  Launch SSMS.  
  
2.  In SSMS, connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
3.  Click **View** and then **Utility Explorer**.  
  
4.  In the Utility Explorer navigation pane, click ![](../../relational-databases/manage/media/connect-to-utility.gif "Connect_to_Utility")**Connect to Utility**.  
  
5.  In the **Connect to Server** dialog box, specify the UCP instance name, then click **Connect**.  
  
6.  View the Utility Explorer Navigation Pane to see a tree view of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] resources in the UCP.  
  
 Creating a new UCP also connects you to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Utility. For more information, see [Create a SQL Server Utility Control Point &#40;SQL Server Utility&#41;](../../relational-databases/manage/create-a-sql-server-utility-control-point-sql-server-utility.md).
