  In [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion_md](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] Report Designer in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], the Report Data pane displays a hierarchical view of data objects that you can use in a report, including data sources, datasets, fields, parameters, and images. Data sources in this view can be embedded or references to shared data sources that are displayed in Solution Explorer.
