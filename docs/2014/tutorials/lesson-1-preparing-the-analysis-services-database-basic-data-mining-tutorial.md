# Lesson 1: Preparing the Analysis Services Database (Basic Data Mining Tutorial)
  You are a new employee of [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBCoFull](../includes/sssampledbcofull-md.md)] who has been tasked with designing a business intelligence application in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)]. [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBCoFull](../includes/sssampledbcofull-md.md)] hopes to leverage your [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] data mining experience to discover interesting and actionable information about people who have purchased bicycles. They then want you to predict which prospective customers are most likely to purchase a bicycle in the future.  
  
 Designing this application in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] starts with the creation in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] of a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] project based on the [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] project template for multidimensional modeling and data mining. After you create an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] project, you define one or more data sources. Then, you define a view of the metadata, called a *data source view*, from selected tables and views from the data sources.  
  
 In this lesson, you will create an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] project, define a single data source, and add a subset of tables to a data source view. This lesson includes the following tasks:
