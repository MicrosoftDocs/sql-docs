# Lesson 1-5 - Show the Object Explorer Details Page
[!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] can show a report for each object selected in Object Explorer. This report, called the Object Explorer Details page, is created by [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)], and opens in the document window.  
  
## Showing the Object Explorer Details Page  
  
#### To show the Summary page  
  
-   On the **View** menu, click **Object Explorer Details**. The **Object Explorer Details** page opens, if it is not already open, and comes to the front if it is open in the background.  
  
-   Or, at any time, you can press F7 to display the **Object Explorer Details** page.  
  
At each level in Object Explorer, the **Object Explorer Details** page provides the information you are most likely to need about the object. If the list of objects is large, the **Object Explorer Details** page may take longer to process the information.  
  
The **Object Explorer Details** page has two panes. The **List** pane in the top part of the page presents a list of the objects in the selected node of Object Explorer. Below the **List** pane, the **Details** pane presents information most likely to be of interest for each object type. Use the **List** view to multi-select objects when deleting many items.
