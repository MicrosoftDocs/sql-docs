# System Requirements
  [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Management Objects (SMO) uses the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] **System.Data.SqlClient** object driver to connect to and communicate with instances of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 SMO clients require [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client, which is included with [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] 2.0.  
  
 To develop applications by using SMO, you must have [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] 2008 installed.
