| Error | Severity | Event logged | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 41401 | 16 | No | WSFC cluster service is offline. |
| 41402 | 16 | No | The WSFC cluster is offline, and this availability group is not available. This issue can be caused by a cluster service issue or by the loss of quorum in the cluster. |
| 41403 | 16 | No | Availability group is offline. |
| 41404 | 16 | No | The availability group is offline, and is unavailable. This issue can be caused by a failure in the server instance that hosts the primary replica or by the WSFC availability group resource going offline. |
| 41405 | 16 | No | Availability group is not ready for automatic failover. |
| 41406 | 16 | No | The availability group is not ready for automatic failover. The primary replica and a secondary replica are configured for automatic failover, however, the secondary replica is not ready for an automatic failover. Possibly the secondary replica is unavailable, or its data synchronization state is currently not in the SYNCHRONIZED synchronization state. |
| 41407 | 16 | No | Some availability replicas are not synchronizing data. |
| 41408 | 16 | No | In this availability group, at least one secondary replica has a NOT SYNCHRONIZING synchronization state and is not receiving data from the primary replica. |
| 41409 | 16 | No | Some synchronous replicas are not synchronized. |
| 41410 | 16 | No | In this availability group, at least one synchronous replica is not currently synchronized. The replica synchronization state could be either SYNCHRONIZING or NOT SYNCHRONIZING. |
| 41411 | 16 | No | Some availability replicas do not have a healthy role. |
| 41412 | 16 | No | In this availability group, at least one availability replica does not currently have the primary or secondary role. |

| 41417 | 16 | No | Availability replica is disconnected. |
| 41418 | 16 | No | This secondary replica is not connected to the primary replica. The connected state is DISCONNECTED. |
| 41419 | 16 | No | Data synchronization state of some availability database is not healthy. |
| 41420 | 16 | No | At least one availability database on this availability replica has an unhealthy data synchronization state. If this is an asynchronous-commit availability replica, all availability databases should be in the SYNCHRONIZING state. If this is a synchronous-commit availability replica, all availability databases should be in the SYNCHRONIZED state. |

| 41427 | 16 | No | Availability replica is not joined. |
| 41428 | 16 | No | This secondary replica is not joined to the availability group. For an availability replica to be successfully joined to the availability group, the join state must be Joined Standalone Instance (1) or Joined Failover Cluster (2). For information about how-to join a secondary replica to an availability group, see SQL Server Books Online. |
