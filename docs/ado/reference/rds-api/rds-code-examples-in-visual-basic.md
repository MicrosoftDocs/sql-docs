# RDS Code Examples in Visual Basic
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Beginning with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, RDS server components are no longer included in the Windows operating system (see Windows 8 and [Windows Server 2012 Compatibility Cookbook](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=27416) for more detail). RDS client components will be removed in a future version of Windows. Avoid using this feature in new development work, and plan to modify applications that currently use this feature. Applications that use RDS should migrate to [WCF Data Service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=199565).  
  
 Use the following code examples to learn how to use RDS properties when writing in Visual Basic.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Paste the entire code example, from Sub to End Sub, into your code editor. The example may not run correctly if partial examples are used or if paragraph formatting is lost.
