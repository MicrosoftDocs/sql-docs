# How to: Browse Objects in a SQL Server Database Project

The SQL Server Object Explorer in Visual Studio now contains a dedicated Projects node, under which all SQL Server database projects in your solution are grouped in an SQL Server Management Studio-like hierarchy.  
  
## To browse objects in a project instance  
  
1.  In Visual Studio, make sure that **SQL Server Object Explorer** is open. If it is not, click the **View** menu and select **SQL Server Object Explorer**.  
  
2.  Make sure you have a SQL Server database project.  
  
3.  In **SQL Server Object Explorer**, expand the **Projects** node to see all the current SQL Server database projects in your solution under the **Projects** node.
