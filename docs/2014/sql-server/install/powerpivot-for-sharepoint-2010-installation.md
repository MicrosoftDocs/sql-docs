# PowerPivot for SharePoint 2010 Installation
  [!INCLUDE[ssGeminiShort](../../includes/ssgeminishort-md.md)] is a collection of server components that provide query processing and management control over [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../includes/ssgemini-md.md)] workbooks that you publish to SharePoint. Services include the Analysis Services engine and [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../includes/ssgemini-md.md)] System Service.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  For information regarding [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11SP1](../../includes/sssql11sp1-md.md)] and installation with SharePoint Server 2013, see the following:  
>   
>  -   The "SQL Server 2012 SP1" section of [Overview of SQL Server Servicing Installation](../../../2014/sql-server/install/overview-of-sql-server-servicing-installation.md).  
  
 Analysis Services provides server-side processing for Excel workbooks that contain [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../includes/ssgemini-md.md)] data. [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../includes/ssgemini-md.md)] System Service works alongside Analysis Services, adding SharePoint integration, load balancing and connection management. [!INCLUDE[ssGeminiShort](../../includes/ssgeminishort-md.md)] extends Excel Services by pairing its large scale data processing capability with the data rendering services that Excel provides.  
  
 To install [!INCLUDE[ssGeminiShort](../../includes/ssgeminishort-md.md)], use the [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)]installation media.
