# Create a Basic Table Report (SSRS Tutorial)
  This tutorial is designed to help you create a basic table report based on the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBobject](../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database using Report Designer. You can also use Report Builder or the Report Wizard to create reports. In this tutorial, you will create a report project, set up connection information, define a query, add a Table data region, group and total some fields, and preview the report.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  To complete this tutorial, you must be running [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] in native mode. If you are running [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] in SharePoint integrated mode, the steps that use report server URLs do not work. For more information about [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] modes, see [Reporting Services Report Server](reporting-services-report-server.md).
