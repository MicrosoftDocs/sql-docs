It does not include announcements about discontinued support for specific versions of the operating system or [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] Internet Information Services (IIS). For more information about system prerequisites, see [Hardware and Software Requirements for Installing SQL Server 2016](../sql-server/install/hardware-and-software-requirements-for-installing-sql-server.md).
