# Creating Rowsets with ICommand::Execute
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md.md)]

  For rowsets created by using the **ICommand::Execute** method, the properties that you want in the resulting rowset can constrain the text of the command. This is especially critical for consumers that support dynamic command text.  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider cannot use [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] cursors to support the multiple-rowset results generated by many commands. If a consumer requests a rowset requiring [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] cursor support, an error occurs if the command text generates more than a single rowset as its result. For more information, see [Commands Generating Multiple-Rowset Results](../../relational-databases/native-client-ole-db-commands/commands-generating-multiple-rowset-results.md).  
  
 Scrollable [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider rowsets are supported by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] cursors. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] imposes limitations on cursors that are sensitive to changes made by other users of the database. Specifically, the rows in some cursors cannot be ordered, and trying to create a rowset by using a command that contains an SQL ORDER BY clause can fail. For more information, see [Rowsets and SQL Server Cursors](../../relational-databases/native-client-ole-db-rowsets/rowsets-and-sql-server-cursors.md).
