# About the SQL Server License Terms
  The [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] Software License Terms are copied to the local computer when [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is installed. When multiple instances of the same edition and language of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] are installed on the same computer, a single copy of the license terms will apply to all instances of that edition and language. The files are written to: %ProgramFiles%\\[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]\120\License Terms\ or %ProgramFiles(x86)%\ [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]\120\License Terms\\.  
  
 When multiple instances of the same [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] edition and language are installed on the same computer, a single copy of the license terms will apply to all instances of that edition and language.  
  
 The license terms file name indicates the edition of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] as well as the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] language edition that is installed. The License terms file name is in the format: SQLServer2014_License_Edition_\<TYPE>_\<LCID>.rtf. For example:  
  
-   SQLServer2014_License_DEV_1033.rtf for [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../includes/sssql14-md.md)] Developer, English language edition.  
  
-   SQLServer2014_License_EXPR_1033.rtf for [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../includes/sssql14-md.md)] Express, English language edition.  
  
 TYPE indicates the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] edition. The following file name segments are used to identify [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] editions:  
  
-   ENT - Enterprise Edition: Server/Client Access License (CAL) Licensing  
  
-   ENTCORE - Enterprise Edition: Core-based Licensing  
  
-   BI - Business Intelligence  
  
-   DEV - Developer  
  
-   STD - Standard  
  
-   WEB - Web  
  
-   EXPR - Express  
  
 LCID is a number, which refers to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] language locale ID.  The following file name segments are used to identify the corresponding [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] languages:
