# Lesson 2-5 - Summary - Configuring Permissions on Database Objects
Logins give users permissions to connect to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Users are logins that can access a specific database. Use the GRANT statement to give users permission to read and to access and change the data.  
  
A view is a single SELECT statement and looks like a table to the user. A stored procedure is one or more [!INCLUDE[tsql](../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements that execute as a batch.
