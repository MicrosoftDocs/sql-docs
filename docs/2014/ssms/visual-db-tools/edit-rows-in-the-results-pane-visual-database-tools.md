# Edit Rows in the Results Pane (Visual Database Tools)
  In many cases, you can edit the data in the [Results Pane](visual-database-tools.md). For more detailed information about changing data see [Rules for Updating Results &#40;Visual Database Tools&#41;](rules-for-updating-results-visual-database-tools.md) and [Work with Data in the Results Pane &#40;Visual Database Tools&#41;](work-with-data-in-the-results-pane-visual-database-tools.md).  
  
### To edit data in the Results pane  
  
1.  Run the query or view that has the data you want to edit.  
  
2.  Navigate to the cells containing the data you want to change.  
  
3.  Type in the new data.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  To enter a null value type NULL in capital letters. The Results pane will format the word with italics to indicate it is a null value and not a string.  
  
4.  Save your changes by leaving the row.
