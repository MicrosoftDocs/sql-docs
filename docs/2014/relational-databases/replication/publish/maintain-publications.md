# Maintain Publications
  After you have created a publication, it might be necessary to add or drop articles, or change publication and article properties. Most changes are allowed after a publication is created, but in some cases, it is necessary to generate a new snapshot for a publication and/or reinitialize subscriptions to the publication. For more information, see [Change Publication and Article Properties](change-publication-and-article-properties.md) and [Add Articles to and Drop Articles from Existing Publications](add-articles-to-and-drop-articles-from-existing-publications.md).
