# TimeAttributeBinding Data Type (ASSL)
  Defines a derived data type that represents a "placeholder" binding for generated data items, such as the key columns of an attribute, in a server time dimension.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```xml  
  
<TimeAttributeBinding>  
   <!-- TimeAttributeBinding has no child elements other than those inherited from Binding -->  
</TimeAttributeBinding>  
```  
  
## Data Type Characteristics  
  
|Characteristic|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|Base data types|[Binding](../../../analysis-services/scripting/data-type/binding-data-type-assl.md)|  
|Derived data types|None|  
  
## Data Type Relationships  
  
|Relationship|Element|  
|------------------|-------------|  
|Parent elements|None|  
|Child elements|None|  
|Derived elements|See [Binding](../../../analysis-services/scripting/data-type/binding-data-type-assl.md)|  
  
## Remarks  
 For more information about the **Binding** type, including tables of Analysis Services Scripting Language (ASSL) objects of the **Binding** type and the inheritance hierarchy of **Binding** types, see [Binding Data Type &#40;ASSL&#41;](../../../analysis-services/scripting/data-type/binding-data-type-assl.md).  
  
 For an overview of data bindings in ASSL, see [Data Sources and Bindings &#40;SSAS Multidimensional&#41;](../../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/data-sources-and-bindings-ssas-multidimensional.md).  
  
 The corresponding element in the Analysis Management Objects (AMO) object model is <xref:Microsoft.AnalysisServices.TimeAttributeBinding>.
