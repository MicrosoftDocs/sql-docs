# Make an Attribute Group Visible to Users (Master Data Services)
  In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)], make an attribute group visible to users or groups when you want users to have tabs above the grid in the **Explorer** functional area.  
  
 When you create an attribute group, it is automatically hidden from all users except the one who created it.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform this procedure:  
  
-   You must have permission to access the **System Administration** functional area.  
  
-   You must be a model administrator. For more information, see [Administrators &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](administrators-master-data-services.md).  
  
-   At least one attribute group must exist. For more information, see [Create an Attribute Group &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../../2014/master-data-services/create-an-attribute-group-master-data-services.md).  
  
### To make an attribute group visible to users  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)], click **System Administration**.  
  
2.  On the **Model View** page, from the menu bar, point to **Manage** and click **Attribute Groups**.  
  
3.  From the **Model** list, select a model.  
  
4.  From the **Entity** list, select an entity.  
  
5.  Click the plus sign to expand **Leaf Groups**, **Consolidated Groups**, or **Collection Groups**, depending on the type of group you want to make visible.  
  
6.  Click the plus sign to expand the group you want to make visible.  
  
7.  Click either **Users** or **Groups**, depending on whether you are making the group visible to a user or a group.  
  
8.  Click **Edit selected item**.  
  
9. Click users or groups in the **Available** box and click the **Add** arrow. To add all, click the **Add All** arrow.  
  
10. Click **Save**.
