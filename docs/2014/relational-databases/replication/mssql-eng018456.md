## Explanation  
 Error MSSQL_ENG018456 is raised whenever a login attempt fails. If the error message includes the account **distributor_admin** (Login failed for user 'distributor_admin'.), the issue is with an account used by replication. Replication creates a remote server, **repl_distributor**, which allows communication between the Distributor and Publisher. The login **distributor_admin** is associated with this remote server and must have a valid password.  
  
## User Action  
 Ensure that you have specified a password for this account. For more information, see [Secure the Distributor](security/secure-the-distributor.md).
