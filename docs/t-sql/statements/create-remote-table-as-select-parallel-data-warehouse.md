# CREATE REMOTE TABLE AS SELECT (Parallel Data Warehouse)
[!INCLUDE [pdw](../../includes/applies-to-version/pdw.md)]

  Selects data from a [!INCLUDE [ssPDW](../../includes/sspdw-md.md)] database and copies that data to a new table in an SMP [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database on a remote server. [!INCLUDE [ssPDW](../../includes/sspdw-md.md)] uses the appliance, with all the benefits of MPP query processing, to select the data for the remote copy. Use `CREATE REMOTE TABLE AS SELECT` for scenarios that require [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] functionality.  
  
 To configure the remote server, see [Remote Table Copy](../../analytics-platform-system/remote-table-copy.md).

## Syntax
  
```syntaxsql
CREATE REMOTE TABLE { database_name.schema_name.table_name | schema_name.table_name | table_name }  AT ('<connection_string>')  
    [ WITH ( BATCH_SIZE = batch_size ) ]  
    AS <select_statement>  
[;]  
  
<connection_string> ::=   
    Data Source = { IP_address | hostname } [, port ]; User ID = user_name ;Password = password;  
  
<select_statement> ::=  
    [ WITH <common_table_expression> [ ,...n ] ]  
    SELECT <select_criteria>  
```  
  
## Arguments

#### *database_name*  
 The database to create the remote table in. *database_name* is a [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database. Default is the default database for the user login on the destination [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance.  
  
#### *schema_name*  
 The schema for the new table. Default is the default schema for the user login on the destination [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance.  
  
#### *table_name*  
 The name of the new table. For details on permitted table names, see "Object Naming Rules" in the [!INCLUDE [pdw-product-documentation](../../includes/pdw-product-documentation-md.md)].  
  
 The remote table is created as a heap. It does not have check constraints or triggers. The collation of the remote table columns is the same as the collation of the source table columns. This applies to columns of type **char**, **nchar**, **varchar**, and **nvarchar**.  
  
#### *connection_string*  
 A character string that specifies the `Data Source`, `User ID`, and `Password` parameters for connecting to the remote server and database.  
  
 The connection string is a semicolon-delimited list of key and value pairs. Keywords are not case-sensitive. Spaces between key and value pairs are ignored. However, values might be case-sensitive, depending on the data source.  
  
#### *Data Source*  
 The parameter that specifies the name or IP address, and TCP port number for the remote SMP [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
#### *hostname* or *IP_address*  
 Name of the remote server computer or the IPv4 address of the remote server. IPv6 addresses are not supported. You can specify a [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] named instance in the format **Computer_Name\Instance_Name** or **IP_address\Instance_Name**. The server must be remote and therefore cannot be specified as (local).  
  
#### TCP *port* number  
 The TCP port number for the connection. You can specify a TCP port number from 0 to 65535 for an instance of SQL Server that is not listening on the default port 1433. For example: **ServerA,1450** or **10.192.14.27,1435**  
  
   > [!NOTE]  
   > We recommend connecting to a remote server by using the IP address. Depending on your network configuration, connecting by using the computer name might require additional steps to use your non-appliance DNS server to resolve the name to the correct server. This step is not necessary when connecting with an IP address. For more information, see "Use a DNS Forwarder to Resolve Non-Appliance DNS Names (Analytics Platform System)" in the [!INCLUDE [pdw-product-documentation](../../includes/pdw-product-documentation-md.md)].  
  
#### *user_name*  
 A valid [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] authentication login name. Maximum number of characters is 128.  
  
#### *password*  
 The login password. Maximum number of characters is 128.  
  
#### *batch_size*  
 The maximum number of rows per batch. [!INCLUDE [ssPDW](../../includes/sspdw-md.md)] sends rows in batches to the destination server. *Batch_size* is a positive integer >= 0. Default is 0.  
  
#### WITH *common_table_expression*  
 Specifies a temporary named result set, known as a common table expression (CTE). For more information, see [WITH common_table_expression (Transact-SQL)](../queries/with-common-table-expression-transact-sql.md).  
  
#### SELECT <select_criteria> 
 The query predicate that specifies which data will populate the new remote table. For information on the SELECT statement, see [SELECT (Transact-SQL)](../queries/select-transact-sql.md).  
  
## Permissions
 Requires:  
  
-   SELECT permission on each object in the SELECT clause.  
  
-   Requires CREATE TABLE permission on the destination SMP database.  
  
-   Requires ALTER, INSERT, and SELECT permissions on the destination SMP schema.  
  
## Error Handling
 If copying data to the remote database fails, [!INCLUDE [ssPDW](../../includes/sspdw-md.md)] aborts the operation, log an error, and attempt to delete the remote table. [!INCLUDE [ssPDW](../../includes/sspdw-md.md)] does not guarantee a successful cleanup of the new table.  
  
## Limitations

 **Remote Destination Server**:  
  
-   TCP is the default and only supported protocol for connecting to a remote server.  
  
-   The destination server must be a nonappliance server. CREATE REMOTE TABLE cannot be used to copy data from one appliance to another.  
  
-   The CREATE REMOTE TABLE statement only creates new tables. Therefore, the new table cannot already exist. The remote database and schema must already exist.  
  
-   The remote server must have space available to store the data that is transferred from the appliance to the [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] remote database.  
  
 **SELECT statement**:  
  
-   The ORDER BY and TOP clauses are not supported in the select criteria.  
  
-   CREATE REMOTE TABLE cannot be run inside an active transaction or when the AUTOCOMMIT OFF setting is active for the session.  
  
 [SET ROWCOUNT (Transact-SQL)](set-rowcount-transact-sql.md) has no effect on this statement. To achieve a similar behavior, use [TOP (Transact-SQL)](../queries/top-transact-sql.md).  
  
## Locking behavior
 After creating the remote table, the destination table is not locked until the copy starts. Therefore, it is possible for another process to delete the remote table after it is created and before the copy starts. When this occurs, [!INCLUDE [ssPDW](../../includes/sspdw-md.md)] generates an error and the copy fails.  
  
## Metadata
 Use [sys.dm_pdw_dms_workers (Transact-SQL)](../../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-pdw-dms-workers-transact-sql.md) to view the progress of copying the selected data to the remote SMP server. Rows with type PARALLEL_COPY_READER contain this information.  
  
## Security
 CREATE REMOTE TABLE uses [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Authentication to connect to the remote [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance; it does not use Windows Authentication.  
  
 The [!INCLUDE [ssPDW](../../includes/sspdw-md.md)] external facing network must be firewalled, with exception of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] ports, administrative ports, and management ports.  
  
 To help prevent accidental data loss or corruption, the user account that is used to copy from the appliance to the destination database should have only the minimum required permissions on the destination database.  
  
 Connection settings allow you to connect to the SMP [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance with SSL protecting user name and password data, but with actual data being sent unencrypted in clear text. When this occurs, a malicious user could intercept the CREATE REMOTE TABLE statement text, which contains the [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] user name and password to sign in to the SMP [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance. To avoid this risk, use data encryption on the connection to the SMP [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance.  
  
## <a id="Examples"></a> Examples
  
### <a id="a-creating-a-remote-table"></a> A. Create a remote table
 This example creates a [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] SMP remote table called `MyOrdersTable` on database `OrderReporting` and schema `Orders`. The `OrderReporting` database is on a server named `SQLA` that listens on the default port 1433. The connection to the server uses the credentials of the user `David`, whose password is `e4n8@3`.  
  
```sql  
CREATE REMOTE TABLE OrderReporting.Orders.MyOrdersTable  
AT ( 'Data Source = SQLA, 1433; User ID = David; Password = e4n8@3;' )  
AS SELECT <select_criteria>;  
```  
  
### <a id="b-querying-the-sysdm_pdw_dms_workers-dmv-for-remote-table-copy-status"></a> B. Query the sys.dm_pdw_dms_workers DMV for remote table copy status
 This query shows how to view copy status for a remote table copy.  
  
```sql  
SELECT * FROM sys.dm_pdw_dms_workers   
WHERE type = 'PARALLEL_COPY_READER';  
```  
  
### <a id="c-using-a-query-join-hint-with-create-remote-table"></a> C. Use a query join hint with CREATE REMOTE TABLE
 This query shows the basic syntax for using a query join hint with CREATE REMOTE TABLE. After the query is submitted to the Control node, [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], running on the Compute nodes, will apply the hash join strategy when generating the [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] query plan. For more information on join hints and how to use the OPTION clause, see [OPTION clause (Transact-SQL)](../queries/option-clause-transact-sql.md).  
  
```sql  
USE ssawPDW;  
CREATE REMOTE TABLE OrderReporting.Orders.MyOrdersTable  
AT ( 'Data Source = SQLA, 1433; User ID = David; Password = e4n8@3;' )  
    AS SELECT T1.* FROM OrderReporting.Orders.MyOrdersTable T1   
    JOIN OrderReporting.Order.Customer T2  
    ON T1.CustomerID=T2.CustomerID OPTION (HASH JOIN);  
```
