# REVOKE Certificate Permissions (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Revokes permissions on a certificate.  
  
 ![Topic link icon](../../database-engine/configure-windows/media/topic-link.gif "Topic link icon") [Transact-SQL Syntax Conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
REVOKE [ GRANT OPTION FOR ] permission  [ ,...n ]   
    ON CERTIFICATE :: certificate_name   
    { TO | FROM } database_principal [ ,...n ]  
    [ CASCADE ]  
    [ AS revoking_principal ]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 GRANT OPTION FOR  
 Indicates that the ability to grant the specified permission will be revoked. The permission itself will not be revoked.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  If the principal has the specified permission without the GRANT option, the permission itself will be revoked.  
  
 *permission*  
 Specifies a permission that can be revoked on a certificate. Listed below.  
  
 ON CERTIFICATE **::**_certificate_name_  
 Specifies the certificate on which the permission is being revoked. The scope qualifier "::" is required.  
  
 *database_principal*  
 Specifies the principal from which the permission is being revoked. One of the following:  
  
-   database user  
  
-   database role  
  
-   application role  
  
-   database user mapped to a Windows login  
  
-   database user mapped to a Windows group  
  
-   database user mapped to a certificate  
  
-   database user mapped to an asymmetric key  
  
-   database user not mapped to a server principal.  
  
 CASCADE  
 Indicates that the permission being revoked is also revoked from other principals to which it has been granted by this principal.  
  
> [!CAUTION]  
>  A cascaded revocation of a permission granted WITH GRANT OPTION will revoke both GRANT and DENY of that permission.  
  
 AS *revoking_principal*  
 Specifies a principal from which the principal executing this query derives its right to revoke the permission. One of the following:  
  
-   database user  
  
-   database role  
  
-   application role  
  
-   database user mapped to a Windows login  
  
-   database user mapped to a Windows group  
  
-   database user mapped to a certificate  
  
-   database user mapped to an asymmetric key  
  
-   database user not mapped to a server principal.  
  
## Remarks  
 A certificate is a database-level securable contained by the database that is its parent in the permissions hierarchy. The most specific and limited permissions that can be revoked on a certificate are listed below, together with the more general permissions that include them by implication.  
  
|Certificate permission|Implied by certificate permission|Implied by database permission|  
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------|  
|CONTROL|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|TAKE OWNERSHIP|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|ALTER|CONTROL|ALTER ANY CERTIFICATE|  
|REFERENCES|CONTROL|REFERENCES|  
|VIEW DEFINITION|CONTROL|VIEW DEFINITION|  
  
## Permissions  
 Requires CONTROL permission on the certificate.
