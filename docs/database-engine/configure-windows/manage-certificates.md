# Certificate management (SQL Server Configuration Manager)

[!INCLUDE [sql-windows-only](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-windows-only.md)]

This article describes how to deploy and manage certificates across your [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Always On failover cluster instance (FCI) or availability group (AG) topology.

SSL/TLS certificates are widely used to secure access to [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. With earlier versions of [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], organizations with large [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] estates had to spend considerable effort to maintain their [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] certificate infrastructure, often through developing scripts and running manual commands.

With [!INCLUDE [sssql19-md](../../includes/sssql19-md.md)] and later versions, certificate management is integrated into the [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Configuration Manager, which simplifies the following common tasks:

- View and validate certificates installed in a [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance.
- Identify which certificates might be close to expiring.
- Deploy certificates across AG machines from the node holding the primary replica.
- Deploy certificates across FCI machines from the active node.

You can use certificate management in [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Configuration Manager with earlier versions of [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], starting with [!INCLUDE [sql2008-md](../../includes/sql2008-md.md)].

## <a id="provision-single-server-cert"></a> Install a certificate for a single SQL Server instance

::: moniker range=">=sql-server-ver15"

1. In [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Configuration Manager, in the console pane, expand **SQL Server Network Configuration**.

1. Right-click **Protocols for** *&lt;instance Name&gt;*, and then select **Properties**.

1. Choose the **Certificate** tab, and then select the certificate from the dropdown list, then select **Apply**. > [!NOTE]  
> There is no version of SQL that has an Import button or wizard in the instance Properties dialogue.  Please correct the page to reflect a feature that exists.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="<= sql-server-2017"

1. In [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Configuration Manager, in the console pane, expand **SQL Server Network Configuration**.

1. Right-click **Protocols for** *&lt;instance Name&gt;*, and then select **Properties**.

1. Select a certificate from the **Certificate** dropdown list, and then select **Apply**.

## <a id="provision-failover-cluster-cert"></a> Install a certificate in a failover cluster instance configuration

1. In [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Configuration Manager, in the console pane, expand **SQL Server Network Configuration**.

1. Right-click **Protocols for** *&lt;instance Name&gt;*, and then choose **Properties**.

1. Choose the **Certificate** tab, and then select the certificate from the dropdown list, then select **Apply**.


> [!NOTE]  
> Complete these steps in the active node of the FCI. User must have administrator permissions on all the cluster nodes.

## <a id="provision-availability-group-cert"></a> Install a certificate in an availability group configuration

1. In [!INCLUDE [ssnoversion-md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Configuration Manager, in the console pane, expand **SQL Server Network Configuration**.

1. Right-click **Protocols for** *&lt;instance Name&gt;*, and then select **Properties**.

1. Choose the **Certificate** tab, and then select **Import**. > [!NOTE]  
> There is no version of SQL that has an Import button or wizard in the instance Properties dialogue.

1. Choose the certificate type and select **Next** to select from the list of known availability groups.

1. Select **Next** to choose certificates for each replica node. Certificates should have a file name that matches the netbios name of the nodes.

1. Select **Next** to import the certificate on each node.

> [!NOTE]  
> Complete these steps from the node holding the AG primary replica. User must have administrator permissions on all the cluster nodes.
