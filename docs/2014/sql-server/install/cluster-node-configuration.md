# Cluster Node Configuration
  Use the Cluster Node Configuration page to add or remove nodes from a failover cluster instance.To install or upgrade a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] failover cluster, you must run the Setup program on each node of the failover cluster. To add a node to an existing [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] failover cluster, you must run [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup on the node that is to be added to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] failover cluster instance.  
  
## Options  
 **[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Instance Name** - Use the drop-down list to select the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] failover cluster instance to modify.  
  
 **Name of this node** - This field will be populated with the name of the computer that is running [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup. This is the failover cluster node that will be added to or removed from the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] failover cluster instance.
