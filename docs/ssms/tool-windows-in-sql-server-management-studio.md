# Tool windows in SQL Server Management Studio

[!INCLUDE[SQL Server Azure SQL Database Synapse Analytics PDW](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

 SQL Server Management Studio provides many powerful tool windows for all phases of development and administration. Some tools can be used on any [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] component, and others are for certain components only. The following table identifies the tools that can be used for all components of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
|Tool|Purpose|
|----|-------|
| [Object Explorer](../ssms/object/object-explorer.md) | Browse servers, create and locate objects, manage data sources, and view logs. This tool is accessed from the **View** menu.|  
| [Solution Explorer](../ssms/solution/solution-explorer.md) | Store and organize scripts and related connection information in projects called [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Scripts. You can store several [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Scripts as Solutions and use source control to manage scripts as they evolve over time. This tool is accessed from the **View** menu. |
| [Template Explorer](../ssms/template/template-explorer.md) | Create queries based on existing templates. You can also create your custom queries or alter the existing templates to fit your scenarios. This tool is accessed from the **View** menu. |
| [Dynamic Help](../ssms/user-assistance-in-sql-server-management-studio.md) | Show a list of related Help topics as you click on a component or type code. |

The tools in SQL Server Management Studio work together.

For example, you can:

- Register a server with Object Explorer.  

- Open a SQL Editor window connected to a specific database from Object Explorer.
