# Overview of the Microsoft Drivers for PHP for SQL Server

[!INCLUDE[Driver_PHP_Download](../../includes/driver_php_download.md)]

The [!INCLUDE[ssDriverPHP](../../includes/ssdriverphp_md.md)] is a PHP extension that provides data access to SQL Server 2005 and later versions including Azure SQL Database. The extension provides a procedural interface with the SQLSRV driver and an object-oriented interface with the PDO_SQLSRV driver for accessing data in all versions of SQL Server, including Express, beginning with SQL Server 2005. Support for versions 3.1 and later of the drivers begins with SQL Server 2008. The [!INCLUDE[ssDriverPHP](../../includes/ssdriverphp_md.md)] API includes support for Windows Authentication, transactions, parameter binding, streaming, metadata access, and error handling.  
  
To use the [!INCLUDE[ssDriverPHP](../../includes/ssdriverphp_md.md)], you must have the correct version of SQL Server Native Client or Microsoft ODBC Driver installed on the same computer PHP is running.  For more information, see [System Requirements for the Microsoft Drivers for PHP for SQL Server](../../connect/php/system-requirements-for-the-php-sql-driver.md).
