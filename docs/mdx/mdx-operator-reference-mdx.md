# MDX Operator Reference (MDX)


  The Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) language supports arithmetic, logical, comparison, set, string, and unary operators. The following table lists the supported operators and their descriptions.  
  
## In This Section

|[-- &#40;Comment&#41; &#40;MDX&#41;](../mdx/comment-mdx-operator-reference.md)|Indicates comment text that is provided by the user.|  
|[- &#40;Except&#41; &#40;MDX&#41;](../mdx/except-mdx-operator.md)|Performs a set operation that returns the difference between two sets, removing duplicate members.|  
|[- &#40;Negative&#41; &#40;MDX&#41;](../mdx/negative-mdx.md)|Performs a unary operation that returns the negative value of a numeric expression.|

|[^ &#40;Power&#41; &#40;MDX&#41;](../mdx/power-mdx.md)|Performs an arithmetic operation that raises one number by another number.|  
|[Comment &#40;MDX&#41;](../mdx/comment-mdx.md)|Indicates comment text that is provided by the user.|  
|[&#40;Comment&#41; &#40;MDX&#41;](../mdx/comment-mdx-double-slash.md)|Indicates user-provided text.|  
|[: &#40;Range&#41; &#40;MDX&#41;](../mdx/range-mdx.md)|Performs a set operation that returns a naturally ordered set, with the two specified members as endpoints, and all members between the two specified members included as members of the set.|  
|[+ &#40;Add&#41; &#40;MDX&#41;](../mdx/add-mdx.md)|Performs an arithmetic operation that adds two numbers.|  
|[+ &#40;Positive&#41; &#40;MDX&#41;](../mdx/positive-mdx.md)|Performs a unary operation that returns the positive value of a numeric expression.|
