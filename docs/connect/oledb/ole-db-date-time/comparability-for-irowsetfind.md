# Comparability for IRowsetFind
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

[!INCLUDE[Driver_OLEDB_Download](../../../includes/driver_oledb_download.md)]

  For date/time types only, IRowsetFind supports the following comparisons:  
  
-   LT  
  
-   LE  
  
-   EQ  
  
-   GE  
  
-   GT  
  
-   NE  
  
-   IGNORE  
  
 If any other comparison is attempted, DB_E_BADCOMPAREOP is returned. This is consistent with the OLE DB specification.
