# Create a New Solution
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md.md)]
When you create a project, [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] creates a solution to contain it. You can only open one solution at a time. [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] does not allow you to create folders within projects. To organize your work, create multiple projects.  
  
To access Solution Explorer, click **Solution Explorer** on the **View** menu.  
  
### To create a new solution and project  
  
1.  On the **File** menu, point to **New**, and then click **Project**.

3.  Optionally modify the project name in the **Name** text box.  
  
4.  Optionally modify the path for the solution in the **Location** text box.
