# Create a New Tabular Model Project (Analysis Services)
  This topic describes how to create a new, blank tabular model project in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)]. After a new model project has been created, you can begin authoring your model project by importing data from data sources.  
  
#### To create a new, blank tabular model project  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudio](../../includes/ssbidevstudio-md.md)], on the **File** menu, click **New**, and then click **Project**.  
  
2.  In the **New Project** dialog box, under **Installed Templates**, click **Business Intelligence**, and then click **Tabular Model Project**.  
  
3.  In **Name**, type a name for the project, then specify a location and solution name, and then click **OK**.  
  
 After your new project is created, it is important to set project and model properties. For more information, see [Project Properties &#40;SSAS Tabular&#41;](../../analysis-services/tabular-models/project-properties-ssas-tabular.md) and [Model Properties &#40;SSAS Tabular&#41;](../../analysis-services/tabular-models/model-properties-ssas-tabular.md).
