# Processing Results How-to Topics (Native Client OLE DB provider)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

  Processing results in an OLE DB application involves first determining the characteristics of the result set, and then retrieving the data into program variables. If the command executes a stored procedure, you also must know how to process return codes and output parameters from the stored procedures.
