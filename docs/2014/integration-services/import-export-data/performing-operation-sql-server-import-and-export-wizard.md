# Performing Operation (SQL Server Import and Export Wizard)
  Use the **Performing Operation** page to view the progress and the results of the import/export operation, and to interrupt the operation if necessary.  
  
 To learn more about this wizard, see [SQL Server Import and Export Wizard](import-and-export-data-with-the-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md). To learn about the options for starting the wizard, as well as the permissions required to run the wizard successfully, see [Run the SQL Server Import and Export Wizard](start-the-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md).  
  
 The purpose of the SQL Server Import and Export Wizard is to copy data from a source to a destination. The wizard can also create a destination database and destination tables for you. However, if you have to copy multiple databases or tables, or other kinds of database objects, you should use the Copy Database Wizard instead. For more information, see [Use the Copy Database Wizard](../../relational-databases/databases/use-the-copy-database-wizard.md).  
  
## Options  
 **Action**  
 Displays each action that is part of the operation.  
  
 **Status**  
 Displays the success or failure of each action.  
  
 **Message**  
 Displays informational and error messages that the action might generate.  
  
 **Filter**  
 Choose whether you want to display only errors, warnings, or successful actions. You can revert to the default display by choosing **Show All Actions**.  
  
 **Stop**  
 Interrupt the operation, if necessary, by using the **Stop** button.  
  
 **Report**  
 View a report of the results, save the report to a file, copy the report to the clipboard, or send the report by e-mail.
