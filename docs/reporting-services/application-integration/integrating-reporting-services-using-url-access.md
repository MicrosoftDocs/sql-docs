# Integrating Reporting Services Using URL Access
  With URL access, you access reports through a report server URL. A URL request enables you to access a specific report server as well as the reports, resources, and other items in the report server database. You can also customize the report viewing and navigation experience for your users. The query string of the URL contains device information settings, as well as report parameters targeted at your report and the chosen rendering output. The way the report server handles URL requests depends on the parameters, parameter prefixes, and type of item that you are accessing through the URL.  
  
 You can use URL access to embed hyperlinks to reports and other report server items in the applications that you develop, whether in a Windows or Web environment.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The topics in the section provide you with some basic ideas for integration. You can use the information to begin to design and develop your own [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] integration scenarios.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Using URL Access in a Web Application](../../reporting-services/application-integration/integrating-reporting-services-using-url-access-web-application.md)  
 Describes how to use URL access to integrate [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] into a Web environment.  
  
 [Using URL Access in a Windows Application](../../reporting-services/application-integration/integrating-reporting-services-using-url-access-windows-application.md)  
 Describes how to use URL access to integrate [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] into a [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Win32 environment.
