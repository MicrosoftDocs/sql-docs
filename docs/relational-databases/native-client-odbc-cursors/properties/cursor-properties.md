# Cursor Properties
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

  The overall characteristics of a cursor are determined by setting either the ODBC-style cursor type or the SQL-92/ISO cursor behaviors. The following topics describe additional statement and connection attributes that affect the behavior of a cursor.  
  
-   [Cursor Rowset Size](../../../relational-databases/native-client-odbc-cursors/properties/cursor-rowset-size.md)  
  
-   [Cursor Concurrency &#40;ODBC&#41;](../../../relational-databases/native-client-odbc-cursors/properties/cursor-concurrency-odbc.md)  
  
-   [Cursor Transaction Isolation Level](../../../relational-databases/native-client-odbc-cursors/properties/cursor-transaction-isolation-level.md)
