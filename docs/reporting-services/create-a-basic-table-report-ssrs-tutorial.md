# Create a Basic Table Report (SSRS Tutorial)

In this tutorial, you use Report Designer in SQL Server Data Tools to create a basic [!INCLUDE[ssrscurrent-md](../includes/ssrscurrent-md)] paginated report with a table, based on the **[!INCLUDE[sssampledbadventureworks2016_md](../includes/sssampledbadventureworks2016-md.md)]** database. You can also create [!INCLUDE[ssrsnoversion-md](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] paginated reports with Report Builder. 

As you go through this tutorial, you will create a report project, set up connection information, define a query, add a Table data region, group and total some fields, and preview the report.  
  
## Requirements

Your system must have the following installed to use this tutorial:

- [!INCLUDE[sscurrent-md](../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] database engine.  
- [!INCLUDE[ssrscurrent-md](../includes/ssrscurrent-md.md)].
- The [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBAdventureworks2016_md](../includes/sssampledbadventureworks2016-md.md)] database.  For more information, see [Adventure Works Sample Databases)](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases).  
  
 - Make sure the Visual Studio [SQL Server Data Tools](../ssdt/download-sql-server-data-tools-ssdt.md) option and the Visual Studio Extension for "Reporting Services" are installed so you have the SSRS Report Designer.
  
You must also have read-only permissions to retrieve data from the [!INCLUDE[sssampledbadventureworks2016](../includes/sssampledbadventureworks2016-md.md)] database.

**Estimated time to complete the tutorial:** 30 minutes.
