# Search a Report Using URL Access
  You can search a report for a specific set of text using URL access. To search a report, set the value of the *rc:FindString* parameter on the URL equal to the text for which you want to search. Additionally, use the *rc:StartFind* and *rc:EndFind* parameters to narrow your search to specific pages within the report.  
  
## Example  
 The following URL access example searches for the first occurrence of the text "Mountain-400" in the Product Catalog sample report starting with page one and ending with page five:  
  
```  
https://server/Reportserver?/SampleReports/Product Catalog&rs:Command=Render&rc:StartFind=1&rc:EndFind=5&rc:FindString=Mountain-400  
```
