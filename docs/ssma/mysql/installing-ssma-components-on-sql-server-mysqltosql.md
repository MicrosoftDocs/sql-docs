# Install SSMA components on SQL Server (MySQLToSQL)

In addition to installing SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA), you must also install components on the computer that is running [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. These components include the SSMA extension pack, which supports data migration, and MySQL providers to enable server-to-server connectivity.

## SSMA for MySQL extension pack

The SSMA extension pack adds a database, `sysdb`, to the specified instance of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. This database contains the tables and stored procedures that are required to migrate data.

Also, when you migrate data to [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], SSMA creates [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent jobs, when server side data migration engine is used for migrating the data.

### Prerequisites

Before you install the SSMA for MySQL server components on [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], make sure that the computer meets the following requirements:

- [!INCLUDE [msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Windows Installer 3.1 or a later version.
- The [!INCLUDE [msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE [dnprdnshort](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] version 4.7.2 or a later version. You can obtain it from the [.NET Framework Developer Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=48882).
- The MySQL Client Provider, and connectivity to the MySQL database that you want to migrate. You can install providers from the MySQL product media or MySQL Web site.
- The [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Browser service must be running during installation. This is used to populate a list of the instances of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] in the Setup wizard. You can disable the [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Browser service after installation.

  > [!NOTE]  
  > If the [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Browser service is running, but you still don't see a list of instances in Setup, you must unblock UDP port 1434. You can use Windows Firewall to temporarily unblock the port, or you can temporarily disable Windows Firewall. You might also have to temporarily disable antivirus software. Make sure to enable firewalls and antivirus software after installation.

### Install the extension pack

:::image type="icon" source="../../includes/media/download.svg" border="false"::: **[Download Microsoft SQL Server Migration Assistant Extension Pack for MySQL](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=54257)**

You can install the extension pack any time before you migrate data to [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> To install the extension pack, you must be a member of the **sysadmin** server role on the instance of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].

To install the extension pack:

1. Copy SSMA for **SSMAforMySQLExtensionPack_*n*.msi**, where *n* is the build number, to the computer that is running [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].

1. Double-click **SSMAforMySQLExtensionPack_*n*.msi**.

1. On the **Welcome** dialog box, select **Next**.

1. On the **End-User License Agreement** dialog box, read the license agreement. If you agree, select the **I accept the agreement** option, and then select **Next**.

1. On the **Choose Setup Type** dialog box, select **Typical**.

1. On the **Ready to Install** dialog box, select **Install**.

1. On the **Completed the First Step of Installation** dialog box, select **Next**.

   A new dialog box appears, in which you select the instance of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] for the Extension Pack installation.

1. Select the instance of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] where you are migrating MySQL schemas, and then select **Next**.

   The default instance has the same name as the computer. Named instances are followed by a backslash and the instance name.

1. On the connection page, select the authentication method and then select **Next**.

   Windows Authentication uses your Windows credentials to try to sign in the instance of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. If you select Server Authentication, you must enter a [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login name and password.

1. Next step requires you to set the password for a master key that will be used to encrypt any sensitive data stored in the extension pack database during server-side data migration. Provide a strong password and select **Next**.

1. On the next dialog box, select **Install Utilities Database *n* and Install Extension Pack libraries**, where *n* is the version number, and then select **Next**.

   The `sysdb` database is created with the tables and stored procedures required for data migration (using server-side data migration engine) are created in this database.

1. To install the utilities to another instance of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], select **Yes**, and then select **Next**. Or, to exit the wizard, select **No**.
