# Complete the Wizard (SQL Server Import and Export Wizard)
After you specify whether you want to run the copy operation immediately, and after you optionally save the package that the wizard created, the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Import and Export Wizard shows **Complete the Wizard**. On this page, you review the choices that you made in the wizard, and then click **Finish** to start the copy operation.
 
## Screen shot of the Complete the Wizard page 
 The following screen shot shows a simple example of the **Complete the Wizard** page of the wizard.

## Review the options you selected  
 
Review the summary and verify the following information:  
-   The source and destination of the data to copy.
-   The data to copy.
-   Whether the package will be saved.
-   Whether the package will be run immediately.  
  
## What's next?  
 After you review the choices that you made in the wizard and click **Finish**, the next page is **Performing Operation**. On this page, you see the progress and the result of the operation that you configured on the preceding pages. For more info, see [Performing Operation](../../integration-services/import-export-data/performing-operation-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md).
