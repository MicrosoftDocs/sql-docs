# SQL Server Native Client

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Synapse Analytics PDW](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

SQL Server Native Client, also known as SNAC or SQLNCLI, refers to the ODBC and OLE DB drivers for SQL Server, prior to [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../../includes/sssql22-md.md)].

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> [!INCLUDE [snac-removed-oledb-and-odbc](../../includes/snac-removed-oledb-and-odbc.md)]

> [!NOTE]  
> For more information and to download the SNAC or ODBC Drivers, see the [SNAC lifecycle explained blog post](/archive/blogs/sqlreleaseservices/snac-lifecycle-explained). For more information on ODBC Driver for SQL Server, see [Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server](../../connect/odbc/microsoft-odbc-driver-for-sql-server.md).

Information on the [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client features released with [!INCLUDE [ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)], the last available version of SQL Server native Client:

- [SQL Server Native Client Support for LocalDB](features/sql-server-native-client-support-for-localdb.md)
- [Metadata Discovery](features/metadata-discovery.md)
- [UTF-16 Support in SQL Server Native Client 11.0](features/utf-16-support-in-sql-server-native-client-11-0.md)
- [SQL Server Native Client Support for High Availability, Disaster Recovery](features/sql-server-native-client-support-for-high-availability-disaster-recovery.md)
- [Accessing Diagnostic Information in the Extended Events Log](features/accessing-diagnostic-information-in-the-extended-events-log.md)

ODBC in [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client supports three features that were added to standard ODBC in the Windows 7 SDK:

- Asynchronous execution on connection-related operations. For more information, see [Asynchronous Execution](../../odbc/reference/develop-app/asynchronous-execution-polling-method.md).

- C data type extensibility. For more information, see [C Data Types in ODBC](../../odbc/reference/develop-app/c-data-types-in-odbc.md).

  To support this feature in [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client, `SQLGetDescField` can return **SQL_C_SS_TIME2** (for **time** types) or **SQL_C_SS_TIMESTAMPOFFSET** (for **datetimeoffset**) instead of **SQL_C_BINARY**, if your application uses ODBC 3.8. For more information, see [Data Type Support for ODBC Date and Time Improvements](../native-client-odbc-date-time/data-type-support-for-odbc-date-and-time-improvements.md).

- Calling `SQLGetData` with a small buffer multiple times to retrieve a large parameter value. For more information, see [Retrieving Output Parameters Using SQLGetData](../../odbc/reference/develop-app/retrieving-output-parameters-using-sqlgetdata.md).

The following articles describe [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client behavior changes in [!INCLUDE [ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)].

- The value passed to the `pwszName` parameter must be a valid identifier when calling `ICommandWithParameters::SetParameterInfo`. For more information, see [ICommandWithParameters](../native-client-ole-db-interfaces/icommandwithparameters.md).

- `SQLDescribeParam` consistently returns an ODBC specification conforming value. For more information, see [SQLDescribeParam](../native-client-odbc-api/sqldescribeparam.md).
