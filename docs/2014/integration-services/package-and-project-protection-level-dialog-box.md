# Package and Project Protection Level Dialog Box
  Use the **Package Protection Level** dialog box to update the protection level of a package. The protection level determines the protection method, the password or user key, and the scope of package protection. Protection can include all data or sensitive data only.  
  
 To understand the requirements and options for package security, you may find it useful to see [Access Control for Sensitive Data in Packages](security/access-control-for-sensitive-data-in-packages.md) and [Security Overview &#40;Integration Services&#41;](security/security-overview-integration-services.md).  
  
## Options  
 **Package protection level**  
 Select a protection level from the list.  
  
 **Password**  
 If using the **Encrypt sensitive data with password** or **Encrypt all data with password** protection level, type a password.  
  
 **Retype password**  
 Type the password again.
