# MIN (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all-md](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all-md.md)]

  Returns the minimum value in the expression. May be followed by the [OVER clause](../../t-sql/queries/select-over-clause-transact-sql.md).  
  
 ![Topic link icon](../../database-engine/configure-windows/media/topic-link.gif "Topic link icon") [Transact-SQL Syntax Conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```sql  
  
-- Aggregation Function Syntax  
MIN ( [ ALL | DISTINCT ] expression )  
  
-- Analytic Function Syntax   
MIN ( [ ALL ] expression ) OVER ( [ <partition_by_clause> ] [ <order_by_clause> ] )  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 **ALL**  
 Applies the aggregate function to all values. ALL is the default.  
  
 DISTINCT  
 Specifies that each unique value is considered. DISTINCT is not meaningful with MIN and is available for ISO compatibility only.  
  
 *expression*  
 Is a constant, column name, or function, and any combination of arithmetic, bitwise, and string operators. MIN can be used with **numeric**, **char**, **varchar**, **uniqueidentifier**, or **datetime** columns, but not with **bit** columns. Aggregate functions and subqueries are not permitted.  
  
 For more information, see [Expressions &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/language-elements/expressions-transact-sql.md).  
  
 OVER **(** [ _partition\_by\_clause_ ] _order\_by\_clause_**)**  
 *partition_by_clause* divides the result set produced by the FROM clause into partitions to which the function is applied. If not specified, the function treats all rows of the query result set as a single group. *order_by_clause* determines the logical order in which the operation is performed. *order_by_clause* is required. For more information, see [OVER Clause &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/queries/select-over-clause-transact-sql.md).  
  
## Return Types  
 Returns a value same as *expression*.  
  
## Remarks  
 MIN ignores any null values.  
  
 With character data columns, MIN finds the value that is lowest in the sort sequence.  
  
 MIN is a deterministic function when used without the OVER and ORDER BY clauses. It is nondeterministic when specified with the OVER and ORDER BY clauses. For more information, see [Deterministic and Nondeterministic Functions](../../relational-databases/user-defined-functions/deterministic-and-nondeterministic-functions.md).  
  
## Examples  
  
### A. Simple example  
 The following example returns the lowest (minimum) tax rate. The example uses the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBnormal](../../includes/sssampledbnormal-md.md)] database  
  
```  
SELECT MIN(TaxRate)  
FROM Sales.SalesTaxRate;  
GO  
```  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]  
  
 ```
 -------------------
  
 5.00
  
 (1 row(s) affected)
 ```  
  
### B. Using the OVER clause  
 The following example uses the MIN, MAX, AVG and COUNT functions with the OVER clause to provide aggregated values for each department in the `HumanResources.Department` table in the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBnormal](../../includes/sssampledbnormal-md.md)] database.  
  
```  
SELECT DISTINCT Name  
       , MIN(Rate) OVER (PARTITION BY edh.DepartmentID) AS MinSalary  
       , MAX(Rate) OVER (PARTITION BY edh.DepartmentID) AS MaxSalary  
       , AVG(Rate) OVER (PARTITION BY edh.DepartmentID) AS AvgSalary  
       ,COUNT(edh.BusinessEntityID) OVER (PARTITION BY edh.DepartmentID) AS EmployeesPerDept  
FROM HumanResources.EmployeePayHistory AS eph  
JOIN HumanResources.EmployeeDepartmentHistory AS edh  
     ON eph.BusinessEntityID = edh.BusinessEntityID  
JOIN HumanResources.Department AS d  
 ON d.DepartmentID = edh.DepartmentID  
WHERE edh.EndDate IS NULL  
ORDER BY Name;  
```  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]  
  
```  
Name                          MinSalary             MaxSalary             AvgSalary             EmployeesPerDept

### C. Using MIN  
 The following example uses the MIN aggregate function to return the price of the least expensive (minimum) product in a specified set of sales orders.  
  
```  
-- Uses AdventureWorks  
  
SELECT DISTINCT MIN(UnitPrice)  
FROM dbo.FactResellerSales   
WHERE SalesOrderNumber IN (N'SO43659', N'SO43660', N'SO43664');  
```  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]  
  
 ```
 ------  
 5.1865
 ```  
  
### D. Using MIN with OVER  
 The following examples use the MIN OVER() analytic function to return the price of the least expensive product in each sales order. The result set is partitioned by the `SalesOrderID` column.  
  
```  
-- Uses AdventureWorks  
  
SELECT DISTINCT MIN(UnitPrice) OVER(PARTITION BY SalesOrderNumber) AS LeastExpensiveProduct,  
       SalesOrderNumber  
FROM dbo.FactResellerSales    
WHERE SalesOrderNumber IN (N'SO43659', N'SO43660', N'SO43664')  
ORDER BY SalesOrderNumber;  
```  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]  
  
 ```
LeastExpensiveProduct SalesOrderID

28.8404               SO43664
