# Property Pages in SQL Server Management Studio

[!INCLUDE[SQL Server Azure SQL Database Synapse Analytics PDW](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

Property page dialog boxes in [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] SQL Server Management Studio all use a common format displaying information with expanding and collapsing categories. The fields shown depend on the particular property. Properties shown in gray are read-only. Categorized and Alphabetic buttons are near the top of each property page.  
  
The following table describes the common elements of Management Studio property page dialog boxes.  
  
|Element|Description|  
|-----------|---------------|  
|**Categorized**|Lists all properties and property values for the selected object, sorted by category. In category view, you can collapse a category to reduce the number of visible properties. When you expand or collapse a category, you see a plus sign (+) or minus sign (-) to the left of the category name. Categories are listed alphabetically.|  
|**Alphabetic**|Lists all properties and property values for the selected object, sorted alphabetically.|  
|Property name|The first column in the grid lists the property names.|  
|Properties|The second column in the grid lists the property values.|  
|Description pane|The description pane appears at the bottom of the page and shows the property type and a short description of the property. You can turn the description of the property off and on using the **Description** command on the shortcut menu.|
