# sys.dm_database_backups

[!INCLUDE [Azure SQL Database](../../includes/applies-to-version/asdb.md)]

Returns information about backups of a database in an [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)] server.

> [!NOTE]  
> Although the `sys.dm_database_backups` DMV is currently in preview and is available for all Azure SQL Database service tiers, the Hyperscale tier will not have correct content as it is snapshot based and in the snapshot you can see only Transaction log backup apart from the first Full Back Up.

| Column name | Data type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `backup_file_id` | **uniqueidentifier** | ID of the generated backup file. Not null. |
| `logical_database_id` | **uniqueidentifier** | Logical database ID of the [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)] on which the operation is performed. Not null. |
| `physical_database_name` | **nvarchar(128)** | Name of the physical [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)] on which the operation is performed. Not null. |
| `logical_server_name` | **nvarchar(128)** | Name of the logical server on which the [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)] that is being backed up is present. Not null. |
| `logical_database_name` | **nvarchar(128)** | User-created name of the database on which the operation is performed. Not null. |
| `backup_start_date` | **datetime2(7)** | Timestamp when the backup operation started. Not null. |
| `backup_finish_date` | **datetime2(7)** | Timestamp when the backup operation finished. Not null. |
| `backup_type` | **char(1)** | Type of backup. Not null.<br /><br />D = Full database backup<br />I = Incremental or differential backup<br />L = Log backup. |
| `in_retention` | **bit** | Backup retention status. Tells whether backup is within retention period. Null.<br /><br />1 = In retention<br />0 = Out of retention. |

## Permissions

On SQL Database Basic, S0, and S1 service objectives, and for databases in elastic pools, the server admin account, the Microsoft Entra ID admin account, or membership in the ##MS_ServerStateReader## server role is required. On all other SQL Database service objectives, either the VIEW DATABASE STATE permission on the database, or membership in the ##MS_ServerStateReader## server role, is required.

## Remarks

Backups retained and shown in the backup history view depend on configured backup retention. Some backups older than the retention period (`in_retention = 0`) are also shown in the `sys.dm_database_backups` view. They're needed to do point in time restore within the configured retention.

## Example

Show list of all active backups for the current database ordered by backup finish date.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM sys.dm_database_backups
ORDER BY backup_finish_date DESC;
```

To get a user friendly list of backups for a database, please run:

```sql
SELECT backup_file_id, 
    backup_start_date,
    backup_finish_date,
    CASE backup_type
        WHEN 'D' THEN 'Full'
        WHEN 'I' THEN 'Differential'
        WHEN 'L' THEN 'Transaction log'
        END AS BackupType,
    CASE in_retention
        WHEN 1 THEN 'In retention'
        WHEN 0 THEN 'Out of retention'
        END AS IsBackupAvailable
FROM sys.dm_database_backups
ORDER BY backup_start_date DESC;
```
