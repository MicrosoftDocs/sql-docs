# Supported Data Types (ODBC Driver for Oracle)
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  This feature will be removed in a future version of Windows. Avoid using this feature in new development work, and plan to modify applications that currently use this feature. Instead, use the ODBC driver provided by Oracle.  
  
 The ODBC Driver for Oracle supports all Oracle 7.3 data types; however, it does not support any of the new Oracle8 data types listed here.
