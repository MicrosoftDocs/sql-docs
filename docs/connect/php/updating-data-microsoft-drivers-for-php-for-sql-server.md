# Updating Data (Microsoft Drivers for PHP for SQL Server)
[!INCLUDE[Driver_PHP_Download](../../includes/driver_php_download.md)]

The topics in this section address how to update data in a database by examining common use cases.  
  
The steps for using the [!INCLUDE[ssDriverPHP](../../includes/ssdriverphp_md.md)] to update data in a database can be summarized as follows:  
  
1.  Define a Transact-SQL query that performs an insert, update, or delete operation.  
  
2.  Update parameter values for parameterized queries.  
  
3.  Execute the Transact-SQL queries with the updated parameter values (if applicable). See [Comparing Execution Functions](../../connect/php/comparing-execution-functions.md) for more information about executing a query.
