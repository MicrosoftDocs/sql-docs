# Data Mining Algorithms (SQL Server Data Mining Add-ins)
  The Data Mining Add-ins for Office supports creation of analytical models using the following data mining algorithms. All algorithms are based on well-known machine learning methods and have been implemented by Microsoft Research.  
  
## Algorithms  
  
|Machine learning method|How it works|  
|-----------------------------|------------------|  
|Microsoft Association Rules  algorithm|Discover which products are purchased together or which events occur together, and use the model to create recommendations.<br /><br /> [https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms174916.aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms174916.aspx)|  
|Microsoft Clustering algorithm|Define market segments, automatically group related customers together, or find relationships in data to use in further mining.<br /><br /> [https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms174879.aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms174879.aspx)|  
|Microsoft Decision Trees algorithm|Identify previously unknown relationships between various elements of your data to better inform your decisions, or find the factors that lead to specific outcomes.<br /><br /> [https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms174923.aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms174923.aspx)|  
|Microsoft Linear Regression algorithm|Find a mathematical formula that describes factors that contribute to a numeric outcome.<br /><br /> [https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms174824.aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms174824.aspx)|  
|Microsoft Logistic Regression algorithm|Identify the factors that contribute to binary outcomes, and learn how to use those to affect results.<br /><br /> [https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms174828.aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms174828.aspx)|  
|Microsoft Naïve Bayes algorithm|Explore relationships in your data and find those mostly closely correlated with an outcome.<br /><br /> [https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms174806.aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms174806.aspx)|  
|Microsoft Neural Networks algorithm|Find hidden relationships among multiple inputs and even multiple outputs. Use for exploration or for prediction.<br /><br /> [https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms174941.aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms174941.aspx)|  
|Microsoft Time Series algorithm|Use historical data to forecast future values.<br /><br /> [https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms174923.aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms174923.aspx)|  
  
## Advanced Options  
 When you use the Data Mining Client for Excel, you have the option to create your own data mining structures and models, or to fine-tune the parameters of the algorithms.  
  
 [Algorithm Parameters &#40;SQL Server Data Mining Add-ins&#41;](algorithm-parameters-sql-server-data-mining-add-ins.md)  
  
 There are two ways to customize your models using these advanced options:  
  
-   Use the **Data Mining Query** wizard to create your model.  
  
-   In the **Data Mining Client**, after you start the wizard, click **Parameters**.
