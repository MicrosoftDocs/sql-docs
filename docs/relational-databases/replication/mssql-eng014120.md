|Message Text|Could not drop the distribution database '%s'. This distributor database is associated with a Publisher.|  
  
## Explanation  
 The distribution database stores metadata and history data for all types of replication and transactions for transactional replication. This error occurs if you attempt to drop a distribution database that is associated with one or more Publishers.  
  
## User Action  
 To drop a distribution database you must first drop the association between the Distributor and the Publisher. For more information, see [sp_dropdistpublisher &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-dropdistpublisher-transact-sql.md).
