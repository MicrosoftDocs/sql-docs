# Publisher Properties - Publisher, Subscribers
  The **Subscribers** page of the **Publisher Properties** dialog box is used for Publishers running versions of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] prior to [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../includes/ssversion2005-md.md)]. The page allows you to enable Subscribers to receive data from publications on this Publisher. Enabling a Subscriber to receive data from this Publisher does not create subscriptions to publications on this Publisher. To create a subscription, you must use the New Subscription Wizard.  
  
## Options  
 **Subscribers**  
 The **Subscribers** property grid shows Subscribers that are enabled to receive data from publications on this Publisher. Click the properties button (**...**) next to a Subscriber to view and set additional properties.  
  
 **Add**  
 Click **Add** to add a Subscriber, and then click **Add SQL Server Subscriber** or **Add Non-SQL Server Subscriber**.
