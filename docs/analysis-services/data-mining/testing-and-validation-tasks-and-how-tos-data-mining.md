# Testing and Validation Tasks and How-tos (Data Mining)
  You can use the **Mining Accuracy Chart** tab of Data Mining Designer in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] to compare the predictive accuracy of the mining models in your mining structure.  
  
 You can create four kinds of charts:  
  
-   Lift chart  
  
-   Profit chart  
  
-   Classification matrix  
  
-   Cross-validation report  
  
 The first three charts use the **Input Selection** tab to define the data that is used for generating the chart.  
  
 The Cross-validation chart is created by using additional inputs, available on the **Cross-Validation** tab. For more information, see [Cross-Validation &#40;Analysis Services - Data Mining&#41;](../../analysis-services/data-mining/cross-validation-analysis-services-data-mining.md).  
  
 For more information about how to use the mining accuracy chart, see [Testing and Validation &#40;Data Mining&#41;](../../analysis-services/data-mining/testing-and-validation-data-mining.md).
