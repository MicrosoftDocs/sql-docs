# Delete a Derived Hierarchy (Master Data Services)
  In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)], delete a derived hierarchy when you are sure you no longer need it.

## Prerequisites

-   You must have permission to access the **System Administration** functional area.  
  
-   You must be a model administrator. For more information, see [Administrators &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](administrators-master-data-services.md).  
  
### To delete a derived hierarchy  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)], click **System Administration**.  
  
2.  On the **Model View** page, from the menu bar, point to **Manage** and click **Derived Hierarchies**.
