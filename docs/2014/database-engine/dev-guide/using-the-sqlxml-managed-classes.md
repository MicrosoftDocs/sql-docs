# Using the SQLXML Managed Classes
  This section provides sample applications that demonstrate how to use the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] SQLXML Managed Classes.  
  
 For information about accessing and modifying data in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] within the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] .NET Framework, and about using DiffGrams to update data in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] tables, see [Accessing SQLXML Functionality in the .NET Environment](../../relational-databases/sqlxml-annotated-xsd-schemas-xpath-queries/net-framework-classes/accessing-sqlxml-functionality-in-the-net-environment.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  You can also write [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Visual Studio applications to bulk load XML documents by using XML Bulk Load. For more information, see [Performing Bulk Load of XML Data &#40;SQLXML 4.0&#41;](../../relational-databases/sqlxml-annotated-xsd-schemas-xpath-queries/bulk-load-xml/performing-bulk-load-of-xml-data-sqlxml-4-0.md). You must add a reference to the XML Bulk Load DLL (Xblkld4.dll) in your application. This is a COM DLL for which Visual Studio .NET automatically creates the wrapper library.
