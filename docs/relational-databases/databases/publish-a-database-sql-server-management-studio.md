# Publish a Database (SQL Server Management Studio)
 [!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]
  You can use the **Generate and Publish Scripts Wizard** to publish an entire database or individual database objects to a Web hosting provider.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The functionality described in this topic used to be provided by the Publish Database Wizard. The publishing functionality has been added to the Generate and Publish Scripts Wizard, and the Publish Database Wizard has been discontinued.  
  
## Generate Scripts Wizard  
  
 The Generate Scripts Wizard can be used to create a script for transferring a database.  
  
#### To publish a database   
  
1.  In Object Explorer, expand **Databases**, right-click a database, point to **Tasks**, and then click **Generate Scripts**. Follow the steps in the wizard to script the database objects.  
  
2.  On the **Choose Objects** page, select the objects to be published.  
  
3.  On the **Set Scripting Options** page, modify script with **Advance** options, then select **Save as script file**.
