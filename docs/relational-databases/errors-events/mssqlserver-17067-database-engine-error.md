|||  
|-|-|  
|Product Name|SQL Server|  
|Event ID|17067|  
|Event Source|MSSQLSERVER|  
|Component|SQLEngine|  
|Symbolic Name|SQLASSERT_MESG|  
|Message Text|SQL Server Assertion: File: \<%s>, line = %d %s. This error may be timing-related. If the error persists after rerunning the statement, use DBCC CHECKDB to check the database for structural integrity, or restart the server to ensure in-memory data structures are not corrupted.|  
  
## Explanation  
This error can be caused by transient, timing-related errors, or by in-memory or on-disk data corruption.  
  
## User Action  
Rerun the statement that caused the exception to fire. If the error was caused by a timing-related event, the error may not recur. If the problem persists, run DBCC CHECKDB to check for on-disk corruption. Restart the server to ensure that the in-memory data structures are not corrupted.
