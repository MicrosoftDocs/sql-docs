# Implementing a Security Extension
  [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Windows Authentication is the primary system for securing reports in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)]. In certain cases, however, you may need to extend the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] security system to accommodate custom security in your enterprise. You can do this using the development platform provided by the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] API. This section will present an overview of security extensions in [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 For complete details about implementing, deploying, and removing a [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] security extension, please see [SQL Server Reporting Services Product Samples](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=177889).

 [Authentication in Reporting Services](authentication-in-reporting-services.md)
