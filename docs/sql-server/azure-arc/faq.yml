  - name: General FAQ
    questions:
      - question: Can I exclude any SQL Server instances when I onboard with Azure Policy with SQL Server enabled by Azure Arc? 
        answer: |
          Yes, you can use the `excludedInstances` setting in the Azure Policy to indicate the SQL Server instances that you don't want to include in the onboarding process.
          
          For example, if you have any standby instances, you might not want to view them in the portal. When you use Azure Policy to onboard, you can exclude such instances based using pattern matching of the instance names. 

          1. Create a copy of the definition that we provide in Azure to create a custom definition.
          1. Set the value for excluded instances in the custom definition.
          1. Target the subscription and resource group.

      - question: Is the data from my instance of SQL Server sent to Azure?
        answer: |
           No. Microsoft only captures metadata and information about your SQL Server to help troubleshoot and inventory. The data sent doesn't include user data or about your utilization of SQL Server.

      - question: Does SQL Server enabled by Azure Arc support Private Link?
        answer: |
           Yes. SQL Server enabled by Azure Arc supports Private Link for most endpoints, but some endpoints don't require Private Link and some endpoints aren't supported. For specific information, see [Connected Machine agent network requirements](/azure/azure-arc/servers/network-requirements?tabs=azure-cloud#urls).
           
  - name: Billing
    questions:
      - question: Does pay-as-you-go billing stop charging when connectivity between the SQL Server resource and Azure is temporarily interrupted?
        answer: No, Intermittent internet connectivity doesn't stop the pay-as-you-go billing. The usage is reported and accounted for by the billing logic when the connectivity is restored.

      - question: Do I get charged if my virtual machine is stopped?
        answer: No. When the VM is stopped, the usage data isn't collected. Therefore, you'll not be charged for the time the VM was stopped.  

      - question: Do I get charged if my SQL Server instance is stopped?
        answer: No. The usage data collection requires an active SQL Server instance. Therefore, you'll not be charged for the time the SQL Server instance was stopped.  

      - question: Do I get charged if my SQL Server instance was running for less than an hour?
        answer: The billing granularity is one hour. If your instance was active for less than an hour, you are billed for the full hour. 

      - question: Is there a minimum number of cores with pay-as-you-go billing?
        answer: Pay-as-you-go billing doesn't change the licensing terms of SQL Server. Therefore, it's subject to the four-core limit as defined in the [SQL Server licensing terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/productoffering/SQLServer/EAEAS). 

      - question: If the affinity mask is specified for my SQL Server to use a subset of virtual cores, will it reduce the pay-as-you-go-charges?
        answer: No. When you run your SQL Server instance on a virtual or physical machine, you're required to license the full set of cores that the machine can access. Therefore, your pay-as-you-go charges are based on the full core count even if you use the affinity mask to limit your SQL Server's usage of these cores.   See  [SQL Server licensing guide](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/view/SQL-Server) for details.

      - question: Can I switch from pay-as-you-go to license and vice versa?
        answer: Yes, you can change your selection. To change, run SQL Server Setup again, and choose the **Maintenance** tab, then select **Edition Upgrade**. The mode is now changed to Enterprise license. To revert back to pay-as-you-go, you can use the same steps and change the setting.
