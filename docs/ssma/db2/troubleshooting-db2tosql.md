# Troubleshooting (DB2ToSQL)
It is not uncommon to run into migration issues midway executing the console scripts or commands.  
  
The fixable errors may relate to:  
  
1.  Function  
  
2.  Procedure  
  
3.  View  
  
4.  Trigger  
  
5.  Modifying the data type  
  
6.  Changing the project settings  
  
The issues can be fixed using the SSMA user interface by opening the Project File created through the console.
