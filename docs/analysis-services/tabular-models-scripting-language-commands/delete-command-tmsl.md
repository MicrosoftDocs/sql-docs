# Delete command (TMSL)
[!INCLUDE[ssas-appliesto-sqlas-aas](../../includes/ssas-appliesto-sqlas-aas.md)]
  Deletes a database or an object in the current database.   
It deletes the specified object and all child objects and collections. If the object does not exist, the command raises an error.  
  
## Request  
 The object being deleted is specified by using the object path. For example, deleting a partition requires that you specify the table and database objects that precede it.  
  
```  
{   
  "delete": {   
    "object": {   
      "database": "AdventureworksDW2016",   
      "table": "Reseller Sales",   
      "partition": "may2011"   
    }   
  }   
}   
```  
  
 You can delete the following objects:  
  
 [Database object &#40;TMSL&#41;](../../analysis-services/tabular-models-scripting-language-objects/database-object-tmsl.md)  
  
```  
{

    "object": {   
      "database": "AdventureworksDW2016"  
    }   
  }   
}   
```  
  
 [DataSources object &#40;TMSL&#41;](../../analysis-services/tabular-models-scripting-language-objects/datasources-object-tmsl.md)  
  
```  
{  
  "delete": {  
    "object": {  
      "database": "AdventureworksDW2016",

## Usage (endpoints)  
 This command element is used in  a statement of the [Execute Method &#40;XMLA&#41;](../../analysis-services/xmla/xml-elements-methods-execute.md) call over an XMLA endpoint, exposed in the following ways:  
  
-   As an XMLA window in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)  
  
-   As an input file to the **invoke-ascmd** PowerShell cmdlet  
  
-   As an input to an SSIS task or SQL Server Agent job  
  
 You can generate a ready-made script  for this command from SSMS.  For example, you can right-click an existing database > **Script** > **Script Database as** > **DELETE To**.  
  
 The [\[MS-SSAS-T\]: QL Server Analysis Services Tabular (SQL Server Technical Protocol)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=784855) document includes section 3.1.5.2.2 that describes the structure of JSON tabular metadata commands and objects. Currently, that document covers commands and capabilities not yet implemented in TMSL script. Refer to the topic [Tabular Model Scripting Language &#40;TMSL&#41; Reference](../../analysis-services/tabular-model-scripting-language-tmsl-reference.md) for clarification on what is supported.
