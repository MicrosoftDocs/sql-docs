# Editions and supported features of SQL Server 2016

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server 2016](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2016.md)]

This article provides details of features supported by the SQL Server editions.

For information about other versions, see:

- [SQL Server 2022](editions-and-components-of-sql-server-2022.md)
- [SQL Server 2019](editions-and-components-of-sql-server-2019.md)
- [SQL Server 2017](editions-and-components-of-sql-server-2017.md)
- [SQL Server 2014](/previous-versions/sql/2014/getting-started/features-supported-by-the-editions-of-sql-server-2014?view=sql-server-2014&preserve-view=true).

Installation requirements vary based on your application needs. The different editions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] accommodate the unique performance, runtime, and price requirements of organizations and individuals. The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] components that you install also depend on your specific requirements. The following sections help you understand how to make the best choice among the editions and components available in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].

The SQL Server Evaluation edition is available for a 180-day trial period.

For the latest release notes and what's new information, see the following:

- [SQL Server 2017 release notes](../sql-server/sql-server-2017-release-notes.md)
- [SQL Server 2016 release notes](../sql-server/sql-server-2016-release-notes.md)
- [What's new in SQL Server 2017](../sql-server/what-s-new-in-sql-server-2017.md)

:::image type="icon" source="../includes/media/azure-vm.svg" border="false"::: **[Spin up a Virtual Machine with SQL Server 2016 already installed](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/microsoftsqlserver.sql2017-ws2019?tab=Overview)**

## SQL Server editions

The following table describes the editions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].

| [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] edition | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Enterprise | The premium offering, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssNoVersion-md.md)] Enterprise edition delivers comprehensive high-end datacenter capabilities with blazing-fast performance, unlimited virtualization, and end-to-end business intelligence - enabling high service levels for mission-critical workloads and end-user access to data insights. |
| Standard | [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssNoVersion-md.md)] Standard edition delivers basic data management and business intelligence database for departments and small organizations to run their applications and supports common development tools for on-premises and cloud - enabling effective database management with minimal IT resources. |
| Web | [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssNoVersion-md.md)] Web edition is a low total-cost-of-ownership option for Web hosters and Web VAPs to provide scalability, affordability, and manageability capabilities for small to large-scale Web properties. |
| Developer | [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssNoVersion-md.md)] Developer edition lets developers build any kind of application on top of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. It includes all the functionality of Enterprise edition, but is licensed for use as a development and test system, not as a production server. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Developer is an ideal choice for people who build [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssNoVersion-md.md)] and test applications. |
| Express editions | [!INCLUDE [ssexpress-md](../includes/ssexpress-md.md)] edition is the entry-level, free database and is ideal for learning and building desktop and small server data-driven applications. It is the best choice for independent software vendors, developers, and hobbyists building client applications. If you need more advanced database features, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Express can be seamlessly upgraded to other higher end versions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Express LocalDB, a lightweight version of Express that has all of its programmability features, yet runs in user mode, and has a fast, zero-configuration installation and a short list of prerequisites. |

## Use SQL Server with an Internet server

On an Internet server, such as a server that is running Internet Information Services (IIS), you will typically install the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] client tools. Client tools include the client connectivity components used by an application connecting to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].

> [!NOTE]  
> Although you can install an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on a computer that is running IIS, this is typically done only for small web sites that have a single server computer. Most Web sites have their middle-tier IIS systems on one server or a cluster of servers, and their databases on a separate server or federation of servers.

## SQL Server with client/server applications

You can install just the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] client components on a computer that is running client/server applications that connect directly to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. A client components installation is also a good option if you administer an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on a database server, or if you plan to develop [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] applications.

The client tools option installs the following [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] features: backward compatibility components, [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudio](../includes/ssbidevstudio-md.md)], connectivity components, management tools, software development kit, and [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Books Online components. For more information, see  [Install SQL Server](../database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server.md).

## Decide among SQL Server components

Use the Feature Selection page of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Installation Wizard to select the components to include in an installation of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. By default, none of the features in the tree are selected.

Use the information in the following tables to determine the set of features that best fits your needs.

<sup>1</sup> In-Memory OLTP data size and Columnstore segment cache are limited to the amount of memory specified by edition in the Scale Limits section. The max degree of parallelism is limited. The degree of process parallelism (DOP) for an index build is limited to 2 DOP for the Standard Edition and 1 DOP for the Web and Express Editions. This refers to columnstore indexes created over disk-based tables and memory-optimized tables.

<sup>2</sup> Applies to [!INCLUDE[sssql15-md](../includes/sssql16-md.md)] SP1 as part of creating a Common Programmability Surface Area (CPSA) across editions. Aggregate Pushdown, String Predicate Pushdown, and SIMD Optimizations are [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Enterprise Edition scalability enhancements. For more detail, see [Columnstore indexes - what's new](../relational-databases/indexes/columnstore-indexes-what-s-new.md).

<sup>3</sup> This feature isn't included in the LocalDB installation option.

<sup>4</sup> Standard Edition and SQL Server + CAL-based licensing can restrict how many processors SQL Server Standard can use, but SQL Server Standard is NUMA aware.
