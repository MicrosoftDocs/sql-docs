# Troubleshoot Report Builder
  Report Builder is a [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] report authoring tool that you can use to build reports from many different kinds of data sources and to publish your reports to a report server or SharePoint site. The reports that you create can be viewed in Report Builder, in a Web browser, or as part of a [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] Windows application or SharePoint site.  
  
 To learn how to use Report Builder and perform many basic tasks, see the [Tutorials](report-builder-tutorials.md).  
  
 The following topics can help you troubleshoot reports, depending on whether you are a report author or report server administrator.
