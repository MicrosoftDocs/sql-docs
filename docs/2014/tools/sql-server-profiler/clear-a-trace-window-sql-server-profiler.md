# Clear a Trace Window (SQL Server Profiler)
  This topic describes how to clear the trace window for a trace that is running by using [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../includes/sssqlprofiler-md.md)].  
  
### To clear a trace window  
  
1.  Select the trace window you want to clear.  
  
2.  On the **Edit**menu, click **Clear Trace Window**.  
  
     The contents of the trace window are removed. Note that if the trace file or table has been saved, the contents of the file or table remains unchanged.
