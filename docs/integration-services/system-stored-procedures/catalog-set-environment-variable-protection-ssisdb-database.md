  Sets the sensitivity bit of an environment variable in the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] catalog.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```sql  
catalog.set_environment_variable_protection [ @folder_name = ] folder_name  
    , [ @environment_name = ] environment_name  
    , [ @variable_name = ] variable_name  
    , [ @is_sensitive = ] is_sensitive  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 [ @folder_name = ] *folder_name*  
 The name of the folder that contains the environment. The *folder_name* is **nvarchar(128)**.  
  
 [ @environment_name = ] *environment_name*  
 The name of the environment. The *environment_name* is **nvarchar(128)**.  
  
 [ @variable_name = ] *variable_name*  
 The name of the environment variable. The *variable_name* is **nvarchar(128)**.  
  
 [ @sensitive = ] *sensitive*  
 Indicates whether the variable contains a sensitive value or not. Use a value of `1` to indicate that the value of the environment variable is sensitive or a value of `0` to indicate that it is not. A sensitive value is encrypted when it is stored. A value that is not sensitive is stored in plaintext. The *sensitive* parameter is **bit**.
