|Message Text|The checksum function used by the merge process to perform data validation on article '%1' returned an invalid checksum value. When troubleshooting, use SQL Profiler or restart the agent with a higher value for -HistoryVerboseLevel and check the output log file for errors. Correct any database engine conditions that may be causing the checksum operation to fail.|

## User Action  
 Look for other errors raised by the server. Correct any [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] conditions that might cause the checksum operation to fail.
