# Create a Power View Report with a Multidimensional Data Source
  Creating a Power View report based on a multidimensional model is no different than creating a report based on a [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../includes/ssgemini-md.md)] workbook or an Analysis Services Tabular model. Power View reports are created from a Report Data Source connection file (.rsds) in a SharePoint library. For more information about how to create an .rsds, see [Create a Report Data Source](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/create-a-report-data-source.md).  
  
 Before you begin, you need to know:  
  
-   The name and location of the SharePoint library that contains a shared report data source connection (.rsds) to a multidimensional model.  
  
#### Create a new, blank Power View report  
  
-   In the SharePoint library, click the arrow next to the .rsds shared report data source connection (the .rsds that connects to the multidimensional model), and then click **Create Power View Report**.
