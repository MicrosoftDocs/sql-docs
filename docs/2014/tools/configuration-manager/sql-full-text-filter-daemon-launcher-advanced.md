# SQL Full-text Filter Daemon Launcher (Advanced)
  Beginning in [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)], the SQL Full-text Filter Daemon Launcher service is used by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] full-text. This service must be running if you use full-text search. For information about the filter daemon host processes, see "Full-Text Search Architecture" in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Books Online.  
  
 No properties appear on the **Advanced** tab by default. If custom properties are defined, they also appear on this tab, with their values.
