## Security  
 Dump files might contain sensitive information. To help protect sensitive information, you can use an access control list (ACL) to restrict access to the files, or copy the files to a folder that has restricted access. For example, before you send your debug files to Microsoft support services, we recommend that you remove any sensitive or confidential information.
