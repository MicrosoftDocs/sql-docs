# Report Sections Dialog Box (Report Builder)
  When you open a report, Report Builder verifies that the report contains only one Report Definition Language (RDL) **\<Section>** element. Opening a report with multiple **\<Section>** elements is not supported.  
  
 Although a report definition with multiple sections can be generated programmatically, editing the report in a report authoring environment is not supported.  
  
 To identify the current report definition format for a report, for a report server, for a project, or for your report authoring environment, see [Find the Report Definition Schema Version &#40;SSRS&#41;](../../reporting-services/reports/find-the-report-definition-schema-version-ssrs.md).  
  
 Click **OK** to continue.
