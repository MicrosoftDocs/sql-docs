# Cube Designer (Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data)
  Use **Cube Designer** in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] to edit various properties of an existing cube, including the measure groups and measures, cube dimensions and dimension relationships, calculations, key performance indicators (KPIs), actions, partitions, perspectives, and translations included in the cube, as well as to browse the data contained by the cube. You can display the **Cube Designer** dialog box by:  
  
-   Right-clicking a cube in **Solution Explorer** and selecting **Open** or **View Designer** from the context menu.  
  
-   Double-clicking a cube in **Solution Explorer**.  
  
 The **Cube Designer** contains the following tabs:  
  
## Tabs  
  
|Tab|Definition|  
|---------|----------------|  
|**Cube Structure**|Use this tab to create and modify measure groups and measures, add cube dimensions, and display the objects included in the cube from the associated data source view. For more information about this tab, see [Cube Structure &#40;Cube Designer&#41; &#40;Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data&#41;](cube-structure-cube-designer-analysis-services-multidimensional-data.md).|  
|**Dimension Usage**|Use this tab to create and modify relationships between cube dimensions and measure groups included in the cube. For more information about this tab, see [Dimension Usage &#40;Cube Designer&#41; &#40;Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data&#41;](dimension-usage-cube-designer-analysis-services-multidimensional-data.md).|  
|**Calculations**|Use this tab to create and modify calculations, including calculated members, named sets, and Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) scripts, included in the cube. For more information about this tab, see [Calculations &#40;Cube Designer&#41; &#40;Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data&#41;](calculations-cube-designer-analysis-services-multidimensional-data.md).|  
|**KPIs**|Use this tab to create and modify KPIs included in the cube. For more information about this tab, see [KPIs &#40;Cube Designer&#41; &#40;Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data&#41;](kpis-cube-designer-analysis-services-multidimensional-data.md).|  
|**Actions**|Use this tab to create and modify actions, including drillthrough actions and report actions, included in the cube. For more information about this tab, see [Actions &#40;Cube Designer&#41; &#40;Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data&#41;](actions-cube-designer-analysis-services-multidimensional-data.md).|  
|**Partitions**|Use this tab to create and modify partitions, including proactive caching settings for measure groups and partitions, included in the cube. For more information about this tab, see [Partitions &#40;Cube Designer&#41; &#40;Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data&#41;](partitions-cube-designer-analysis-services-multidimensional-data.md).|  
|**Perspectives**|Use this tab to create and modify perspectives included in the cube. For more information about this tab, see [Perspectives &#40;Cube Designer&#41; &#40;Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data&#41;](perspectives-cube-designer-analysis-services-multidimensional-data.md).|  
|**Translations**|Use this tab to create and modify translations for measure groups, measures, cube dimensions, perspectives, KPIs, actions, named sets, and calculated members included in the cube. For more information about this tab, see [Translations &#40;Cube Designer&#41; &#40;Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data&#41;](translations-cube-designer-analysis-services-multidimensional-data.md).|  
|**Browser**|Use this tab to browse data and metadata for the cube. For more information about this tab, see [Browser &#40;Cube Designer&#41; &#40;Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data&#41;](browser-cube-designer-analysis-services-multidimensional-data.md).|
