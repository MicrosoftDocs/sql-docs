# Configuring the Script Task in the Script Task Editor
  Before you write custom code in the Script task, you configure its principal properties in the three pages of the **Script Task Editor**. You can configure additional task properties that are not unique to the Script task by using the Properties window.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Unlike earlier versions where you could indicate whether scripts were precompiled, all scripts are precompiled beginning in [!INCLUDE[ssISversion10](../../../includes/ssisversion10-md.md)].  
  
## General Page of the Script Task Editor  
 On the **General** page of the **Script Task Editor**, you assign a unique name and a description for the Script task.  
  
## Script Page of the Script Task Editor  
 The **Script** page of the **Script Task Editor** displays the custom properties of the Script task.  
  
### ScriptLanguage Property  
 [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] Tools for Applications (VSTA) supports the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Visual Basic or [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Visual C# programming languages. After you create a script in the Script task, you cannot change value of the **ScriptLanguage** property.  
  
 To set the default script language for Script tasks and Script components, use the **ScriptLanguage** property on the **General** page of the **Options** dialog box. For more information, see [General Page](../../general-page-of-integration-services-designers-options.md).  
  
### EntryPoint Property  
 The **EntryPoint** property specifies the method on the **ScriptMain** class in the VSTA project that the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] runtime calls as the entry point into the Script task code. The **ScriptMain** class is the default class generated by the script templates.  
  
 If you change the name of the method in the VSTA project, you must change the value of the **EntryPoint** property.  
  
### ReadOnlyVariables and ReadWriteVariables Properties  
 You can enter comma-delimited lists of existing variables as the values of these properties to make the variables available for read-only or read/write access within the Script task code. Variables of both types are accessed in code through the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Tasks.ScriptTask.ScriptObjectModel.Variables%2A> property of the **Dts** object. For more information, see [Using Variables in the Script Task](../../../integration-services/extending-packages-scripting/task/using-variables-in-the-script-task.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Variable names are case-sensitive.  
  
 To select the variables, click the ellipsis (**...**) button next to the property field. For more information, see [Select Variables Page](../../../integration-services/control-flow/select-variables-page.md).  
  
### Edit Script Button  
 The **Edit Script** button launches the VSTA development environment in which you write your custom script. For more information, see [Coding and Debugging the Script Task](../../../integration-services/extending-packages-scripting/task/coding-and-debugging-the-script-task.md).  
  
## Expressions Page of the Script Task Editor  
 On the **Expressions** page of the **Script Task Editor**, you can use expressions to provide values for the properties of the Script task listed above and for many other task properties. For more information, see [Integration Services &#40;SSIS&#41; Expressions](../../../integration-services/expressions/integration-services-ssis-expressions.md).
