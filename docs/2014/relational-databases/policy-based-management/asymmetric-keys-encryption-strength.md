# Asymmetric Keys Encryption Strength
  This rule checks whether asymmetric keys were created by using 1024-bit or stronger encryption.  
  
## Best Practices Recommendations  
 Use RSA 1024-bit or stronger encryption to create asymmetric keys for data encryption.  
  
## For More Information
