# O2SS0331: Unable to convert FETCH statement (Error)

This article describes why SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Oracle gives an error when converting the `FETCH ... INTO` statement in a procedure where a `SYS_REFCURSOR` is returned as parameter.

## Background

In Oracle, `SYS_REFCURSOR` is used to pass cursors from and to a stored procedure.

Whenever SSMA encounters a variable for `SYS_REFCURSOR` as a return type of the procedure and use the same variable with `FETCH ... INTO` statement, it generates an error message.

## Example

Consider the below example query in which we have declared a variable as `SYS_REFCURSOR`, used as a return type of a procedure.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE p_close_refcursor
(
    emp_refcur OUT SYS_REFCURSOR
)
IS
    departmentno dept.deptno%TYPE;
BEGIN
    OPEN
        emp_refcur
    FOR
        SELECT deptno
        FROM dept;

    LOOP
        FETCH emp_refcur
        INTO departmentno;

        EXIT WHEN emp_refcur%NOTFOUND;

        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(departmentno);
    END LOOP;

    CLOSE emp_refcur;
END;
```

When you try to convert the above code in SSMA, it generates the following error message:

> O2SS0330: Unable to convert FETCH statement

## Possible remedies

There are two possible remedies for correcting this error.

### Use local cursor variable

First method is to create and use a local cursor for doing all operations, and then passing its value to the returning cursor before closing it. For this, declare a new variable of `SYS_REFCURSOR` type which will be local to this procedure. Modify the code to use this local cursor to perform the required operation including `FETCH ... INTO` statement. Before closing the local cursor, pass the value of this local cursor to the cursor defined in the parameter section of procedure (`emp_refcur` in our example).

The solution for the above error is shown in the code below:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE p_close_refcursor
(
    emp_refcur OUT SYS_REFCURSOR
)
AS
    test_cursor SYS_REFCURSOR;
    departmentno dept.deptno%TYPE;
BEGIN
    OPEN
        test_cursor
    FOR
        SELECT deptno
        FROM dept;

    LOOP
        FETCH test_cursor
        INTO departmentno;

        EXIT WHEN test_cursor%NOTFOUND;

        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(departmentno);
    END LOOP;

    emp_refcur := test_cursor;

    CLOSE test_cursor;
END;
```

### Return result set

Another way to solve this error is to use the natural approach followed in SQL Server which is – returning the result set directly from executing stored procedures. This approach is explained in details in the article for [O2SS0157](o2ss0157.md) conversion message.
