# Upgrade Database Engine
  The topics in this section will help you upgrade the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database engine from a prior release of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)].  
  
1.  [Choose a Database Engine Upgrade Method](../../database-engine/install-windows/choose-a-database-engine-upgrade-method.md) Before beginning an upgrade, you need to understand the various upgrade methods. This topic discusses the upgrade methods and the steps involved with each upgrade method.  
  
2.  [Plan and Test the Database Engine Upgrade Plan](../../database-engine/install-windows/plan-and-test-the-database-engine-upgrade-plan.md) After reviewing the upgrade methods, you are ready to develop the appropriate upgrade method for your environment and then test the upgrade method before upgrading the existing environment. This topic discusses developing an upgrade plan and testing it.  
  
3.  [Complete the Database Engine Upgrade](../../database-engine/install-windows/complete-the-database-engine-upgrade.md) After your databases have been upgraded to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)], there are additional steps you need to take, including taking a new backup, enabling new features, and re-populating full-text catalogs. This topic discusses these steps.  
  
4.  [Change the Database Compatibility Mode and Use the Query Store](../../database-engine/install-windows/change-the-database-compatibility-mode-and-use-the-query-store.md) One of the steps to take after your databases have been upgraded to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] is to enable new features by changing the database compatibility mode and then using the query store to monitor performance. This topic discusses this process and provides a recommended workflow.  
  
5.  [Take Advantage of New SQL Server 2016 Features](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/d8879659-8efa-4442-bcbb-91272647ae16) Finally, after you have completed the previous steps, you are ready to explore taking advantage of specific new database engine enhancements.
