# CONTINUE (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

  Restarts a WHILE loop. Any statements after the CONTINUE keyword are ignored. CONTINUE is frequently, but not always, opened by an IF test. For more information, see [WHILE &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/language-elements/while-transact-sql.md) and [Control-of-Flow Language &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](~/t-sql/language-elements/control-of-flow.md).
