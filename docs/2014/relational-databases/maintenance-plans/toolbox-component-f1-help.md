# Toolbox Component F1 Help

**Toolbox** displays a variety of items for use in [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] projects. You can open the **Toolbox** from the **View** menu, and dock this window as you wish. While docked, the **Toolbox** can either be pinned open or set to **Auto Hide** when not in use.  
  
**Toolbox** icons can be dragged and dropped or copied and pasted into code editors or onto design view surfaces within [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)].  
  
## Using the Toolbox  
 The Toolbox is a sliding tree control that behaves much like [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Windows Explorer, but without grid or connection lines. Multiple segments of the **Toolbox** (called "tabs") can be expanded simultaneously, and the entire tree scrolls inside the **Toolbox** window. To expand any tab of the **Toolbox**, click the plus (**+**) sign next to its name. To collapse an expanded tab, click the minus (**-**) sign next to its name.  
  
 Each time you return to an editor or designer, the **Toolbox** automatically scrolls to the most recent tab and item selected. As you shift focus to a different editor or designer, the current selection in the **Toolbox** shifts with you.  
  
## Customizing the Toolbox  
 It is easy to rearrange items within a tab, and to add custom tabs and items to the **Toolbox**.  
  
 To add or remove **Toolbox** items, on the **Tools** menu, click **Choose Toolbox Items**. Only **Maintenance Tasks** can be made available as **Toolbox** icons. All components are not always available. For instance, maintenance tasks are only available when creating a maintenance plan.
