# Profiling ODBC Driver Performance (ODBC)
[!INCLUDE[SQL Server Azure SQL Database Synapse Analytics PDW](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

  The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] ODBC driver has two driver-specific options for profiling the performance of the driver.  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] ODBC driver can log performance statistics in file. The log file is a tab-delimited file that can be analyzed in any spreadsheet supporting tab-delimited files, such as Microsoft Excel.  
  
 The driver can also log long-running queries (queries that do not get a response from the server in a specified length of time). These queries can later be analyzed by programmers and database administrators.
