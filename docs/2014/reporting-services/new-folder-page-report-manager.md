# New Folder Page (Report Manager)
  Use the New Folder page to create a new folder in the report server folder hierarchy. The folder that you create is a virtual folder that is stored in a report server database. The folder is not created in the file system of your computer.  
  
 A folder is created in-place, as a subfolder of the folder that is currently selected. Before creating a folder, you should navigate to the location where you want to create the folder.  
  
 After you create a folder, you can modify its name and description through the General properties page of the folder.  
  
## Navigation  
 Use the following procedure to navigate to this location in the user interface (UI).  
  
###### To open the New Folder page  
  
1.  Open Report Manager, and navigate to the folder in which you want to create a new folder.  
  
2.  In the toolbar, click **New Folder**.  
  
## Options  
 **Name**  
 Specify the name of the folder. A name must contain at least one alphanumeric character. It can also include spaces and certain symbols. Do not use the characters ; ? : \@ & = + , $ / * \< > | " or / when specifying a name.  
  
 **Description**  
 Type a description of folder contents. This description appears in the Contents page to users who have permission to access the folder.
