  The [SqlService Class](../../../relational-databases/wmi-provider-configuration-classes/sqlservice-class/sqlservice-class.md) represents an instance of a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] service.  
  
 The [SqlService Class](../../../relational-databases/wmi-provider-configuration-classes/sqlservice-class/sqlservice-class.md) is used to programmatically manage the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] service.
