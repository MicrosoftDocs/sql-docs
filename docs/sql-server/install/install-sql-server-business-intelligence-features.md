# Install SQL Server Business Intelligence Features
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly.md)]

  SQL Server features that are part of the Microsoft Business Intelligence platform include [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)], and several client applications used for creating or working with analytical data. This section of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup documentation explains how to install these features.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] can be installed as standalone servers, in scale-out configurations, or as shared service applications in a SharePoint farm. Installing the services in a farm enables BI features that are only available in SharePoint, including [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../includes/ssgemini-md.md)] for SharePoint and [!INCLUDE[ssCrescent](../../includes/sscrescent-md.md)], the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] ad hoc interactive report designer that runs on [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../includes/ssgemini-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion_md](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] tabular model databases.
