# Specify a Unary Operator (Dimension) (Business Intelligence Wizard)
  Use the **Specify a Unary Operator** page to select a dimension that has a parent attribute defined and to which the Business Intelligence Wizard will apply unary operators. For more information about parent attributes, see [Attributes and Attribute Hierarchies](multidimensional-models-olap-logical-dimension-objects/attributes-and-attribute-hierarchies.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  This page does not appear if the Business Intelligence Wizard was started from Dimension Designer or by right-clicking a dimension in Solution Explorer in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)].  
  
## Options  
 **Dimension**  
 Select the dimension that contains a parent attribute and to which the wizard will apply unary operators.
