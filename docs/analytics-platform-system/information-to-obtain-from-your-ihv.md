# Information to Obtain from Your IHV
When your independent hardware vendor (IHV) delivers your new SQL Server PDW appliance to you, they will also deliver information on the appliance hardware and the configuration they have performed on your appliance. You will need this information to administer your appliance.  
  
The following list shows information that is usually needed from your IHV. In some cases, additional or other information is needed. Check with your IHV to make sure all relevant information has been transferred to you with the appliance delivery.  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|**Information or Document**|**Description**|  
|Bill of Materials (BOM)|Your Bill of Materials lists the components that are included in your appliance. This information is necessary to confirm that all components were delivered.<br /><br />**Important:** Your Bill of Materials should include weights for each of the appliance nodes and for each complete rack. This information is important when planning how to handle and move appliance components, and for making sure your data center can accommodate the appliance. If your BOM does not include node weights, make sure to obtain this information from your IHV for all nodes.|  
|Cabling diagrams|Cabling diagrams show how to connect the network, power, and other cables for each appliance rack. These diagrams are needed when installing the appliance in your data center, and any time you need to remove or replace a component.|  
|Appliance racking requirements|Before your appliance can be installed in your data center, you need to know if your data center meets the airflow and cable-length requirements for the appliance, as well as the size and power requirements for the components. See also Bill of Materials (BOM) above for information about appliance component weights, which is also required.|
