# Configure OLE DB Connection Manager
  Use the **Configure OLE DB Connection Manager** dialog box to add a connection to a data source, which can be either a new connection or a copy of an existing connection.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If the data source is [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Office Excel 2007, the data source requires a different connection manager than earlier versions of Excel. For more information, see [Connect to an Excel Workbook](../../integration-services/connection-manager/connect-to-an-excel-workbook.md).  
>   
>  If the data source is [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Office Access 2007, the data source requires a different OLE DB provider than earlier versions of Access. For more information, see [Connect to an Access Database](../../integration-services/connection-manager/connect-to-an-access-database.md).  
  
 To learn more about the OLE DB connection manager, see [OLE DB Connection Manager](../../integration-services/connection-manager/ole-db-connection-manager.md).
