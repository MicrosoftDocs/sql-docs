# SQL Server Migration Assistant for Sybase (SybaseToSQL)
[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE) is a tool for migrating ASE databases to [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame_md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2005 or [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame_md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2008 or [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame_md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2012 or [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame_md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2014 or [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame_md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2016 or [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame_md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2017 on Windows and Linux (Preview) or [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame_md.md)] Azure SQL DB. SSMA for Sybase converts ASE database objects to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database objects, creates those objects in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or Azure SQL, and then migrates data from ASE to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or Azure SQL.  
  
This documentation introduces you to SSMA for Sybase and provides step-by-step instructions for migrating ASE databases to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or SQL Azure and information about issues that might occur after migration. To learn more, see the following topics.
