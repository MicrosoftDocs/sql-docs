# Sample XPath Queries (SQLXML 4.0)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md](../../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
  This section provides examples of XPath queries for SQLXML 4.0. For illustration purposes, these example XPath queries are specified in a template executed using ADO. Therefore, you must use a mapping schema file, SampleSchema1.xml, which is also provided in this section. Save this file in the directory where your templates are stored.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The sample queries in this section are grouped by the type of XPath operation that is performed by the query.
