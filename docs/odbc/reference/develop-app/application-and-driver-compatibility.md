# Application and Driver Compatibility
ODBC applications and driver fall into a number of categories in addition to their version. Some of these applications are incompatible with some drivers; in other cases, the type of the application or driver may have a bearing on the backward compatibility issues between them.  
  
 This section contains the following topics.  
  
-   [Types of Applications](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/types-of-applications.md)  
  
-   [Types of Drivers](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/types-of-drivers.md)  
  
-   [Compatibility Matrix](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/compatibility-matrix.md)
