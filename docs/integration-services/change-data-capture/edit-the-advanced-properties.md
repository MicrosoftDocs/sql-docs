# Edit the Advanced Properties

  Use the **Advanced** tab to add special properties to the CDC instance.  
  
#### To add advanced properties to the CDC instance  
  
1.  Type the name of the property in the **Name** column.  
  
2.  Type a valid value for the property in the **Value** column.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
