# O2SS0029: Cannot convert EXIT statement (Error)

This article describes why SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Oracle doesn't convert the `EXIT` statement when an outer loop is exited from inside the scope of inner loop.

## Background

The `LOOP` statement is used to define a loop with an indeterminate number of iterations. The `EXIT` statement exits a loop and transfers control immediately to the end of the loop.

Whenever an outer loop is exited from inside the scope of inner loop, SSMA can't always convert the `EXIT` statement and generates a conversion error.

## Example

In the following example, the outer loop is exited from inside the scope of inner loop:

```sql
DECLARE
    s PLS_INTEGER := 0;
    i PLS_INTEGER := 0;
    j PLS_INTEGER;
BEGIN
    <<outer_loop>>
    LOOP
        i := i + 1;
        j := 0;

        <<inner_loop>>
        LOOP
            j := j + 1;
            s := s + i * j; -- sum a bunch of products

            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('i: ' || TO_CHAR(i));
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('j: ' || TO_CHAR(j));
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('s: ' || TO_CHAR(s));

            EXIT inner_loop WHEN (j > 5);
            EXIT outer_loop WHEN ((i * j) > 15);
        END LOOP inner_loop;
    END LOOP outer_loop;

    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('The sum of products equals: ' || TO_CHAR(s));
END;
```

When you try to convert the previous code in SSMA, it generates the following error message:

> O2SS0029: Cannot convert EXIT statement

## Possible remedies

The solution to the previous problem is to use statement labels and `GOTO` to break out of the outer loop. Define an `OUTER_LOOP_END` label right after the loop and use `GOTO OUTER_LOOP_END` instead of `BREAK` to break out of the outer loop:

```sql
DECLARE @S INT = 0,
    @I INT = 0,
    @J INT

OUTER_LOOP:

WHILE 1 = 1
BEGIN
    SET @I = @I + 1
    SET @J = 0

    INNER_LOOP:

    WHILE 1 = 1
    BEGIN
        SET @J = @J + 1
        SET @S = @S + @I * @J /* sum a bunch of products*/

        PRINT 'i: ' + ISNULL(CAST(@I AS VARCHAR(MAX)), '')
        PRINT 'j: ' + ISNULL(CAST(@J AS VARCHAR(MAX)), '')
        PRINT 's: ' + ISNULL(CAST(@S AS VARCHAR(MAX)), '')

        IF (@J > 5)
            BREAK

        IF ((@I * @J) > 15)
            GOTO OUTER_LOOP_END
    END
END

OUTER_LOOP_END:

PRINT 'The sum of products equals: ' + ISNULL(CAST(@S AS VARCHAR(MAX)), '');
```
