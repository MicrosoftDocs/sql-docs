# Developing a User Interface for a Custom Log Provider
  Many [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] log providers have a custom user interface that implements <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.Design.IDtsLogProviderUI> and replaces the **Configuration** text box in the **Configure SSIS Logs** dialog box with a filtered dropdown list of available connection managers. However, custom user interfaces for custom log providers are not implemented in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)].
