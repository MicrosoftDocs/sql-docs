# Disconnect from a Registered Server (SQL Server Management Studio)

[!INCLUDE[SQL Server Azure SQL Database Synapse Analytics PDW](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]

This topic describes how to  disconnect Object Explorer from a server at any time in [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Disconnecting Object Explorer does not disconnect other SQL Server Management Studio components such as SQL Editor.

### To disconnect from a registered server

- In Object Explorer, right-click a server and click **Disconnect** or, on the Object Explorer toolbar, click the **Disconnect** icon.
