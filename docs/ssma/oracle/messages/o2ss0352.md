# O2SS0352: BULK COLLECT INTO clause in SELECT statement not converted (Error)

This article covers why SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Oracle does not convert the PL/SQL blocks when `SELECT` statement is used with `BULK COLLECT INTO` clause and `DISTINCT` clause.

## Background

A collection is an ordered group of elements, all of the same type. It is a general concept that encompasses lists, arrays, and other familiar data types. Each element has a unique subscript that determines its position in the collection. The `DISTINCT` clause specifies that only unique value can appear in the result set. The `BULK COLLECT INTO` clause binds the output of the query to the collection, resulting in less communication between the PL/SQL and SQL engines.

SSMA provides a migration path for Oracle collections. However, if the `SELECT` statement used to populate the collection uses a `DISTINCT` clause, SSMA generates the error message.

## Example

Consider the below example in which `SELECT` statement is used with `DISTINCT` clause and `BULK COLLECT INTO` clause:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE BULK_COLLECT_WITH_DISTINCT
AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE
        TYPE tbl_type_DNAME IS TABLE OF varchar2(14);
        var_dname tbl_type_DNAME;
    BEGIN
        SELECT DISTINCT DNAME
        BULK COLLECT INTO var_dname
        FROM dept;

        IF var_dname.COUNT = 0 THEN
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('No results!');
        ELSE
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Results:');

            FOR i IN var_dname.FIRST..var_dname.LAST LOOP
                DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(' DEPT NAME #' || var_dname(i));
            END LOOP;
        END IF;
    END;
END;
```

When you try to convert the above code in SSMA, it generates the following error message:

> O2SS0352: BULK COLLECT INTO clause in SELECT statement not converted

## Possible remedies

To convert the above PL/SQL block we need to replace `DISTINCT` clause with `UNIQUE` clause (a synonym of `DISTINCT`) as shown below:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE BULK_COLLECT_WITH_DISTINCT
AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE
        TYPE tbl_type_DNAME IS TABLE OF varchar2(14);
        var_dname tbl_type_DNAME;
    BEGIN
        SELECT UNIQUE DNAME
        BULK COLLECT INTO var_dname
        FROM dept;

        IF var_dname.COUNT = 0 THEN
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('No results!');
        ELSE
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Results:');

            FOR i IN var_dname.FIRST..var_dname.LAST LOOP
                DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(' DEPT NAME #' || var_dname(i));
            END LOOP;
        END IF;
    END;

END;
```
