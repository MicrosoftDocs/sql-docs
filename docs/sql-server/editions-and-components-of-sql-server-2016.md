# Editions and supported features of SQL Server 2016

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server 2016](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2016.md)]

This article provides details of features supported by the SQL Server editions.

For information about other versions, see:

- [SQL Server 2022](editions-and-components-of-sql-server-2022.md)
- [SQL Server 2019](editions-and-components-of-sql-server-2019.md)
- [SQL Server 2017](editions-and-components-of-sql-server-2017.md)
- [SQL Server 2014](/previous-versions/sql/2014/getting-started/features-supported-by-the-editions-of-sql-server-2014?view=sql-server-2014&preserve-view=true).

Installation requirements vary based on your application needs. The different editions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] accommodate the unique performance, runtime, and price requirements of organizations and individuals. The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] components that you install also depend on your specific requirements. The following sections help you understand how to make the best choice among the editions and components available in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].

The SQL Server Evaluation edition is available for a 180-day trial period.

For the latest release notes and what's new information, see the following:

- [SQL Server 2017 release notes](../sql-server/sql-server-2017-release-notes.md)
- [SQL Server 2016 release notes](../sql-server/sql-server-2016-release-notes.md)
- [What's new in SQL Server 2017](../sql-server/what-s-new-in-sql-server-2017.md)

### Try SQL Server

:::image type="icon" source="../includes/media/azure-vm.svg" border="false"::: **[Spin up a Virtual Machine with SQL Server 2016 already installed](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/microsoftsqlserver.sql2017-ws2019?tab=Overview)**

## SQL Server editions

[!INCLUDE [sql-server-editions](../includes/paragraph-content/sql-server-editions.md)]

## Use SQL Server with an Internet server

On an Internet server, such as a server that is running Internet Information Services (IIS), you will typically install the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] client tools. Client tools include the client connectivity components used by an application connecting to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].

> [!NOTE]  
> Although you can install an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on a computer that is running IIS, this is typically done only for small web sites that have a single server computer. Most Web sites have their middle-tier IIS systems on one server or a cluster of servers, and their databases on a separate server or federation of servers.

## SQL Server with client/server applications

You can install just the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] client components on a computer that is running client/server applications that connect directly to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. A client components installation is also a good option if you administer an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on a database server, or if you plan to develop [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] applications.

The client tools option installs the following [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] features: backward compatibility components, [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudio](../includes/ssbidevstudio-md.md)], connectivity components, management tools, software development kit, and [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Books Online components. For more information, see  [Install SQL Server](../database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server.md).

## Decide among SQL Server components

Use the Feature Selection page of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Installation Wizard to select the components to include in an installation of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. By default, none of the features in the tree are selected.

Use the information in the following tables to determine the set of features that best fits your needs.
