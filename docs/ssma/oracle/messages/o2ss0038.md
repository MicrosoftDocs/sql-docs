# O2SS0038: Hierarchical query not converted (Error)

This article covers some of the reasons why SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Oracle cannot convert a hierarchical query containing complex functions in any sub query.

## Background

A hierarchical query is a type of SQL query that handles hierarchical model data. For each hierarchical query one has to specify a starting condition with the `START WITH` clause, which will trickle down to all dependent rows using one or more conditions specified by the `CONNECT BY` clause.

When converting the hierarchical query, SSMA emulates it to a corresponding solution as a recursive query.

> [!NOTE]
> A recursive CTE can greatly simplify the code required to run a recursive query within a statement. Oracle's `START WITH` clause becomes the first nested `SELECT`, the base case of the recursion, to be `UNION`-ed with the recursive part which is just another `SELECT`.

When aggregate function (i.e. `MAX`, `MIN`, etc.) is used as a part of sub query in a hierarchical query, SSMA cannot convert the hierarchical query to corresponding SQL Server query and generates a conversion error.

## Example

Consider the following example that has an aggregate function (i.e. `MAX`, `MIN`, etc.) used as a part of sub query in a hierarchical query:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE Hierarchy_Test AS
BEGIN
    FOR c IN (
        SELECT
            p.id,
            p.NAME,
            p.parent_id,
            pp.podr_cod,
            pp.count_chel,
            pp.date_start,
            pp.date_finish,
            pp.parent_podr_id
        FROM
            podr p,
            (SELECT *
             FROM podr_param pp
             WHERE pp.ROWID =
                (SELECT SUBSTR(MAX(TO_CHAR(date_start, 'YYYYMMDD') || rowid), 9)
                 FROM podr_param
                 WHERE podr_id=pp.podr_id)) pp
        WHERE p.id = pp.podr_id
        START WITH p.id = 123
        CONNECT BY PRIOR p.id = pp.parent_podr_id)
    LOOP
        dbms_output.put_line(
            RPAD(c.id || ' ', 15)
            || RPAD(c.podr_cod || ' ', 15)
            || RPAD(c.NAME || ' ', 15)
            || RPAD(TO_CHAR(c.date_start, 'DD.MM.YYYY') || ' ', 15)
            || RPAD(TO_CHAR(c.date_finish, 'DD.MM.YYYY'), 15));
    END LOOP;
END;
```

When you try to convert the above code in SSMA, it generates the following error message:

> O2SS0038: Hierarchical query not converted

## Possible remedies

The solution is to simplify the nested sub query containing any aggregate function.

To resolve this error, we'll create a new function in Oracle and call that function in the nested query. The function will calculate the desired value and pass it into the nested query. Below is the sample function, for the above query:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE function max_val(date_start DATE)
RETURN VARCHAR
IS
    val VARCHAR(20);
BEGIN
    SELECT ROWID
    FROM podr_param
    WHERE date_start =
        (SELECT MAX(date_start) INTO val FROM podr_param);

    RETURN (val);
END;
```

You can then call this function within the modified procedure in the nested query and the error will be resolved. The end result would translate the Oracle's `START WITH` clause into the first nested `SELECT`, and `UNION` it with the recursive part which is just another `SELECT`.

Below is the example of the simplified procedure:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE Hierarchy_Test AS
BEGIN
    FOR c IN (
        SELECT
            p.id,
            p.NAME,
            p.parent_id,
            pp.podr_cod,
            pp.count_chel,
            pp.date_start,
            pp.date_finish,
            pp.parent_podr_id
        FROM
            podr p,
            (SELECT *
             FROM podr_param pp
             WHERE pp.ROWID = max_val(date_start)) pp
        WHERE p.id = pp.podr_id
        START WITH p.id = 123
        CONNECT BY PRIOR p.id = pp.parent_podr_id)
    LOOP
        dbms_output.put_line(
            RPAD(c.id || ' ', 15)
            || RPAD(c.podr_cod || ' ', 15)
            || RPAD(c.NAME || ' ', 15)
            || RPAD(TO_CHAR(c.date_start, 'DD.MM.YYYY') || ' ', 15)
            || RPAD(TO_CHAR(c.date_finish, 'DD.MM.YYYY'), 15));
    END LOOP;
END;
```

You can now use SSMA to convert the result to SQL Server.

In most of these situations, consider what the query is trying to accomplish and rewrite it to use the emulation.
