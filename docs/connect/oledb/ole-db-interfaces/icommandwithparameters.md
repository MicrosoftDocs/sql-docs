# ICommandWithParameters
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md](../../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md.md)]

[!INCLUDE[Driver_OLEDB_Download](../../../includes/driver_oledb_download.md)]

  Improvements in the database engine beginning with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] allow ICommandWithParameters::GetParameterInfo to obtain more accurate descriptions of the expected results. These more accurate results may differ from the values returned by CommandWithParameters::GetParameterInfo in previous versions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. For more information, see [Metadata Discovery](../../oledb/features/metadata-discovery.md).  
  
 Also beginning in [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../../includes/sssql11-md.md)], when calling ICommandWithParameters::SetParameterInfo, the value passed to the *pwszName* parameter must be a valid identifier. For more information, see [Database Identifiers](../../../relational-databases/databases/database-identifiers.md).
