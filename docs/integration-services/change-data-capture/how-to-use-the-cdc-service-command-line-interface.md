# How to Use the CDC Service Command-Line Interface

[!INCLUDE[ssis-appliesto](../../includes/ssis-appliesto-ssvrpluslinux-asdb-asdw-xxx.md)]


  The Oracle CDC service program, xdbcdcsvc.exe, normally runs the Oracle CDC Windows service but it can be invoked directly from the command line to create, or delete an Oracle CDC Windows service.  
  
### To use the command line  
  
1.  From the **Start** menu, open the command-line console. Type **cmd** in the run or search box to open the console.  
  
2.  At the command prompt, type **cd** and the full path to the folder where the CDC Service for Oracle is installed.  
  
3.  Type the command that you need to carry out one of the possible tasks.
