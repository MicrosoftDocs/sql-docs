# OLE DB Source Editor (Columns Page)
  Use the **Columns** page of the **OLE DB Source Editor** dialog box to map an output column to each external (source) column.  
  
 To learn more about the OLE DB source, see [OLE DB Source](data-flow/ole-db-source.md).  
  
## Options  
 **Available External Columns**  
 View the list of available external columns in the data source. You cannot use this table to add or delete columns.  
  
 **External Column**  
 View external (source) columns in the order in which you will see them when configuring components that consume data from this source. You can change this order by first clearing the selected columns in the table, and then selecting external columns from the list in a different order.  
  
 **Output Column**  
 Provide a unique name for each output column. The default is the name of the selected external (source) column; however, you can choose any unique, descriptive name. The name provided will be displayed within the SSIS Designer.
