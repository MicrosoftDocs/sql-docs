# sp_replmonitorhelppublication (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Returns current status information for one or more publications at a Publisher. This stored procedure, which is used to monitor replication, is executed at the Distributor on the distribution database.

## Syntax  
  
```  
  
sp_replmonitorhelppublication [ @publisher = ] 'publisher'  
    [ , [ @publisher_db = ] 'publisher_db'   
    [ , [ @publication = ] 'publication'   
    [ , [ @publication_type = ] publication_type ]   
    [ , [ @refreshpolicy = ] refreshpolicy ]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 [ **@publisher** = ] **'***publisher***'**  
 Is the name of the Publisher the status of which is being monitored. *publisher* is **sysname**, with a default value of NULL. If **null**, information will be returned for all Publishers that use the Distributor.  
  
 [ **@publisher_db** = ] **'***publisher_db***'**  
 Is the name of the published database. *publisher_db* is **sysname**, with a default value of NULL. If NULL, then information is returned for all published databases at the Publisher.  
  
 [ **@publication** = ] **'***publication***'**  
 Is the name of the publication being monitored. *publication* is **sysname**, with a default value of NULL.  
  
 [ **@publication_type** = ] *publication_type*  
 If the type of publication. *publication_type* is **int**, and can be one of these values.  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|**0**|Transactional publication.|  
|**1**|Snapshot publication.|  
|**2**|Merge publication.|  
|NULL (default)|Replication attempts to determine the publication type.|  
  
 [ **@refreshpolicy=** ] *refreshpolicy*  
 Internal use only.  
  
## Result Sets  
  
|Column name|Data type|Description|  
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|

|**status**|**int**|Maximum status of all replication agents associated with the publication, which can be one of these values.<br /><br /> **1** = Started<br /><br /> **2** = Succeeded<br /><br /> **3** = In progress<br /><br /> **4** = Idle<br /><br /> **5** = Retrying<br /><br /> **6** = Failed|  
|**warning**|**int**|Maximum threshold warning generated by a subscription belonging to the publication, which can be the logical OR result of one or more of these values.<br /><br /> **1** = expiration - a subscription to a transactional publication has not been synchronized within the retention period threshold.<br /><br /> **2** = latency - the time taken to replicate data from a transactional Publisher to the Subscriber exceeds the threshold, in seconds.<br /><br /> **4** = mergeexpiration - a subscription to a merge publication has not been synchronized within the retention period threshold.<br /><br /> **8** = mergefastrunduration - the time taken to complete synchronization of a merge subscription exceeds the threshold, in seconds, over a fast network connection.<br /><br /> **16** = mergeslowrunduration - the time taken to complete synchronization of a merge subscription exceeds the threshold, in seconds, over a slow or dial-up network connection.<br /><br /> **32** = mergefastrunspeed - the delivery rate for rows during synchronization of a merge subscription has failed to maintain the threshold rate, in rows per second, over a fast network connection.<br /><br /> **64** = mergeslowrunspeed - the delivery rate for rows during synchronization of a merge subscription has failed to maintain the threshold rate, in rows per second, over a slow or dial-up network connection.|  
|**worst_latency**|**int**|The highest latency, in seconds, for data changes propagated by the Log Reader or Distribution Agents for a transactional publication.|  
|**best_latency**|**int**|The lowest latency, in seconds, for data changes propagated by the Log Reader or Distribution Agents for a transactional publication.|  
|**average_latency**|**int**|The average latency, in seconds, for data changes propagated by the Log Reader or Distribution Agents for a transactional publication.|  
|**last_distsync**|**datetime**|Is the last datetime that the Distribution Agent ran.|  
|**retention**|**int**|Is the retention period for the publication.|  
|**latencythreshold**|**int**|Is the latency threshold set for the transactional publication.|  
|**expirationthreshold**|**int**|Is the expiration threshold set for the publication if it is a merge publication.|  
|**agentnotrunningthreshold**|**int**|Is the threshold set for the longest time for an agent not to have run.|  
|**subscriptioncount**|**int**|Is the number of subscriptions to a publication.|  
|**runningdistagentcount**|**int**|Is the number of distribution agents running for the publication|  
|**snapshot_agentname**|**sysname**|Name of the Snapshot Agent job for the publication.|  
|**logreader_agentname**|**sysname**|Name of the Log Reader Agent job for the transactional publication.|  
|**qreader_agentname**|**sysname**|Name of the Queue Reader Agent job for a transactional publication that supports queued updating.|  
|**worst_runspeedPerf**|**int**|Is the longest synchronization time for the merge publication.|  
|**best_runspeedPerf**|**int**|Is the shortest synchronization time for the merge publication.|  
|**average_runspeedPerf**|**int**|Is the average synchronization time for the merge publication.|  
|**retention_period_unit**|**int**|Is the unit used to express *retention*.|
