# Install Reporting Services

[!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] installation involves server components for storing report items, rendering reports, and processing of subscription and other report services.  The steps for a server installation are different for a native mode report server versus as SharePoint mode report server. This section includes detailed topics for installing and verifying core [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] scenarios.
