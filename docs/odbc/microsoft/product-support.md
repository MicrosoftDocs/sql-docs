# Product Support
Product support for ODBC is provided by Microsoft Product Support Services. Because many Microsoft products use ODBC as a core component and also redistribute ODBC drivers, Microsoft Product Support Services considers ODBC to be a part of each product that incorporates ODBC as a component. Support for ODBC is provided in accordance with the support agreement of that product. See the individual product documentation for more information.
