# Expression reference in a paginated report (Report Builder)

[!INCLUDE[ssrs-appliesto](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssrs-appliesto-ssrs-rb](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto-ssrs-rb.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssrs-appliesto-pbi-rb](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto-pbi-rb.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssrb-applies-to-ssdt-yes](../../includes/ssrb-applies-to-ssdt-yes.md)]

  Paginated report expressions support a variety of references to built-in functions and built-in collections. Expressions must have valid [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] syntax before a report can be published or processed.  
  
 To develop complex expressions or expressions that use custom code or custom assemblies, we recommend that you use Report Designer in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)]. For more information, see [Custom Code and Assembly References in Expressions in Report Designer &#40;SSRS&#41;](../../reporting-services/report-design/custom-code-and-assembly-references-in-expressions-in-report-designer-ssrs.md).
