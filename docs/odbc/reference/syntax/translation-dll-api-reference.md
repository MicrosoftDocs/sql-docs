# Translation DLL API Reference
This section describes the syntax of the translation DLL API, which consists of two functions: **SQLDriverToDataSource** and **SQLDataSourceToDriver**. These functions must be included in the DLL that performs translation for the driver.  
  
 This section contains the following topics.  
  
-   [SQLDataSourceToDriver Function](../../../odbc/reference/syntax/sqldatasourcetodriver-function.md)  
  
-   [SQLDriverToDataSource Function](../../../odbc/reference/syntax/sqldrivertodatasource-function.md)
