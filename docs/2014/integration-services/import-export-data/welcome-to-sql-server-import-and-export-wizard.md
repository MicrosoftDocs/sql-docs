# Welcome to SQL Server Import and Export Wizard
  Use the **SQL Server Import and Export Wizard** to copy and transform data between supported data sources and destinations.  
  
 To learn more about this wizard, see [SQL Server Import and Export Wizard](import-and-export-data-with-the-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md). To learn about the options for starting the wizard, and about the permissions required to run the wizard successfully, see [Run the SQL Server Import and Export Wizard](start-the-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md).  
  
 The purpose of the SQL Server Import and Export Wizard is to copy data from a source to a destination. The wizard can also create a destination database and destination tables for you. However, if you have to copy multiple databases or tables, or other kinds of database objects, you should use the Copy Database Wizard instead. For more information, see [Use the Copy Database Wizard](../../relational-databases/databases/use-the-copy-database-wizard.md).  
  
## Options  
 **Do not show this starting page again.**  
 Skip the welcome page the next time that you open the wizard.
