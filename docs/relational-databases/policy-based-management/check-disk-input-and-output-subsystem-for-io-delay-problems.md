# Check Disk Input and Output Subsystem for IO Delay Problems
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
  This rule checks the event log for error message 833. This message indicates that [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] has issued a read or write request from disk, and that the request has taken longer than 15 seconds to return. This error is reported by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and indicates a problem with the disk I/O subsystem. Delays this long can severely damage the performance of your [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] environment.  
  
## Best Practices Recommendations  
 Troubleshoot this error by examining the system event log for hardware-related error messages. Also, examine hardware-specific logs if they are available.  
  
 Use Performance Monitor to examine the following counters:  
  
-   Average Disk Sec/Transfer  
  
-   Average Disk Queue Length  
  
-   Current Disk Queue Length  
  
 For example, the Average Disk Sec/Transfer time on a computer that is running [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is typically less than 15 milliseconds. If the Average Disk Sec/Transfer value increases, this indicates that the disk I/O subsystem is not optimally keeping up with the I/O demand.
