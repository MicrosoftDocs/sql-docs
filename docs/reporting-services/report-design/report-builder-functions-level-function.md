# Report Builder Functions - Level Function
  Returns the current level of depth in a recursive hierarchy.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  [!INCLUDE[ssRBRDDup](../../includes/ssrbrddup-md.md)]  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
Level(scope)  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *scope*  
 (**String**) (Optional). The name of a dataset, group, or data region that contains the report items to which to apply the aggregate function. If *scope* is not specified, the current scope is used.  
  
## Return Type  
 Returns an **Integer**. If *scope* specifies a dataset or data region, or specifies a nonrecursive grouping (that is, a grouping with no **Parent** element), **Level** returns 0. If *scope* is omitted, it returns the level of the current scope.  
  
## Remarks  
 The value returned by the **Level** function is zero based; that is, the first level in a hierarchy is 0.  
  
 The **Level** function can be used to provide indentation in a recursive hierarchy, such as an employee list.  
  
 For more information about recursive hierarchies, see [Creating Recursive Hierarchy Groups &#40;Report Builder and SSRS&#41;](../../reporting-services/report-design/creating-recursive-hierarchy-groups-report-builder-and-ssrs.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following code example provides the level of row in the Employees group:  
  
```  
=Level("Employees")  
```
