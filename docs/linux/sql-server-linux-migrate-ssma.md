[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-linuxonly](../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-linuxonly.md)]

This article introduces [SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt613434.aspx) that helps you easily migrate databases to SQL Server on Linux from Microsoft Access, DB2, MySQL, Oracle, and Sybase. SSMA is a Windows application, so use SSMA when you have a Windows machine that can connect to a remote SQL Server instance on Linux. 

SSMA supports a variety of source databases including Oracle, MySQL, Sybase, DB2, and Microsoft Access to SQL Server on Linux and helps automate migration tasks such as:

- Assess your source database
- Convert the source database schema to Microsoft SQL Server schema
- Migrate the schema
- Migrate the data
- Test the migration

To get started, download SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for your source database from the following list:
- [SSMA for Access](https://aka.ms/ssmaforaccess)
