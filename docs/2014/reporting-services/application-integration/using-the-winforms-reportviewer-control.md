# Using the WinForms ReportViewer Control
  To view reports that have been deployed to a report server or reports that exist on the local file system, you can use the WinForms ReportViewer control to render them in a Windows application.  
  
###### To add the ReportViewer Control to a Windows application  
  
1.  Create a new Windows application using either [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../includes/csprcs-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)].  
  
     \- Or -  
  
     Open an exiting Windows application project and add a new form.  
  
2.  Locate the ReportViewer control in the **Toolbox**. If the **Toolbox** is not visible, you can access it from the **View** menu by selecting **Toolbox**.  
  
     ![Selecting ReportViewer control](../../../2014/reporting-services/media/windowsapp-toolboxreportviewer.png "Selecting ReportViewer control")  
  
3.  Drag the ReportViewer control onto the design surface of the Windows Form.  
  
     A ReportViewer control named reportViewer1 is added to the form.  
  
 After the control is added to the form, the **ReportViewer Tasks** smart tag appears and prompts you to select a report.  
  
 If the report you wish to view has been deployed to a report server, select the **\<Server Report>** option from the **Choose Report** drop-down list. After the **\<Server Report>** option is selected, two additional properties appear: **Report Server Url** and **Report Path**. The **Report Server Url** is the address to the report server and the **Report Path** is the full path to the report to render.  
  
 ![Select server report](../../../2014/reporting-services/media/windowsapp-serverreportsettings.png "Select server report")  
  
 If the report you wish to view a report in local mode, select either the **Design a new report** option to launch the report designer or select a report that is already part of the existing project.  
  
 ![Select local report](../../../2014/reporting-services/media/windowsapp-localreportsettings.png "Select local report")  
  
## Viewing Reports in Remote Processing Mode  
 The following example demonstrates how to render a report that has been deployed to a report server using the WinForms ReportViewer control. This example uses the Sales Order Detail report that is included with the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBobject](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] sample reports project.  
  
```csharp  
public partial class Form1 : Form  
{  
    private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)  
    {  
        // Set the processing mode for the ReportViewer to Remote  
        reportViewer1.ProcessingMode = ProcessingMode.Remote;  
  
        ServerReport serverReport = reportViewer1.ServerReport;  
  
        // Get a reference to the default credentials  
        System.Net.ICredentials credentials =  
            System.Net.CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials;  
  
        // Get a reference to the report server credentials  
        ReportServerCredentials rsCredentials =  
            serverReport.ReportServerCredentials;  
  
        // Set the credentials for the server report  
        rsCredentials.NetworkCredentials = credentials;  
  
        // Set the report server URL and report path  
        serverReport.ReportServerUrl =   
            new Uri("http:// <Server Name>/reportserver");  
        serverReport.ReportPath =   
            "/AdventureWorks Sample Reports/Sales Order Detail";  
  
        // Create the sales order number report parameter  
        ReportParameter salesOrderNumber = new ReportParameter();  
        salesOrderNumber.Name = "SalesOrderNumber";  
        salesOrderNumber.Values.Add("SO43661");  
  
        // Set the report parameters for the report  
        reportViewer1.ServerReport.SetParameters(  
            new ReportParameter[] { salesOrderNumber });  
  
        // Refresh the report  
        reportViewer1.RefreshReport();  
    }  
}  
```  
  
```vb  
Imports Microsoft.Reporting.WinForms  
  
Public Class Form1  
  
    Private Sub Form1_Load(ByVal sender As System.Object, _  
                           ByVal e As System.EventArgs) _  
                           Handles MyBase.Load  
  
        'Set the processing mode for the ReportViewer to Remote  
        reportViewer1.ProcessingMode = ProcessingMode.Remote  
  
        Dim serverReport As ServerReport  
        serverReport = reportViewer1.ServerReport  
  
        'Get a reference to the default credentials  
        Dim credentials As System.Net.ICredentials  
        credentials = System.Net.CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials  
  
        'Get a reference to the report server credentials  
        Dim rsCredentials As ReportServerCredentials  
        rsCredentials = serverReport.ReportServerCredentials  
  
        'Set the credentials for the server report  
        rsCredentials.NetworkCredentials = credentials  
  
        'Set the report server URL and report path  
        serverReport.ReportServerUrl = _  
           New Uri("http://<Server Name>/reportserver")  
        serverReport.ReportPath = _  
           "/AdventureWorks Sample Reports/Sales Order Detail"  
  
        'Create the sales order number report parameter  
        Dim salesOrderNumber As New ReportParameter()  
        salesOrderNumber.Name = "SalesOrderNumber"  
        salesOrderNumber.Values.Add("SO43661")  
  
        'Set the report parameters for the report  
        Dim parameters() As ReportParameter = {salesOrderNumber}  
        serverReport.SetParameters(parameters)  
  
        'Refresh the report  
        reportViewer1.RefreshReport()  
    End Sub  
  
End Class  
```  
  
## Viewing Reports in Local Processing Mode  
 The following example demonstrates how to render a report that is part of the Windows application and has not been deployed to a report server.  
  
###### To add the Sales Order Detail report to a Windows application  
  
1.  Open the Windows project to which the report will be added.  
  
2.  From the **Project** menu, select **Add Existing Item**.  
  
3.  Browse to the location where you installed the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBobject](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] Report Samples project.  
  
     The download the report samples, go to [AdventureWorks 2012 Report Samples](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=404153)  
  
4.  Select the Sales Order Detail.rdl file and click the **Add** button.  
  
     The Sales Order Detail.rdl file should now be part of the project.  
  
     ![Sales Order Detail Report](../../../2014/reporting-services/media/windowsapp-salesorderdetailreport.png "Sales Order Detail Report")  
  
5.  Right-click the Sales Order Detail.rdl file in Solution Explorer and select **Rename**. Rename the report to **Sales Order Detail.rdlc** and press ENTER.  
  
     If Solution Explorer is not visible, you can open it from the **View** menu by selecting **Solution Explorer**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Renaming the file extension from rdl to rdlc will allow you to edit the report using report designer for [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[vsprvslong](../../includes/vsprvslong-md.md)].  
  
6.  After the report has been renamed, select the file and locate the Properties window. Change the **Copy to Output Directory** property to **Copy if Newer**.  
  
     ![Configuring Copy To Output setting](../../../2014/reporting-services/media/windowsapp-copytooutputsetting.png "Configuring Copy To Output setting")  
  
     If the **Properties** window is not visible, you can open it from the **View** menu by selecting **Properties Window**.  
  
 The following code example will create a dataset for the sales order data and then render the Sales Order Detail report in local mode.  
  
```csharp  
public partial class Form1 : Form  
{  
    private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)  
    {  
        // Set the processing mode for the ReportViewer to Local  
        reportViewer1.ProcessingMode = ProcessingMode.Local;  
  
        LocalReport localReport = reportViewer1.LocalReport;  
  
        localReport.ReportPath = "Sales Order Detail.rdlc";  
  
        DataSet dataset = new DataSet("Sales Order Detail");  
  
        string salesOrderNumber = "SO43661";  
  
        // Get the sales order data  
        GetSalesOrderData(salesOrderNumber, ref dataset);  
  
        // Create a report data source for the sales order data  
        ReportDataSource dsSalesOrder = new ReportDataSource();  
        dsSalesOrder.Name = "SalesOrder";  
        dsSalesOrder.Value = dataset.Tables["SalesOrder"];  
  
        localReport.DataSources.Add(dsSalesOrder);  
  
        // Get the sales order detail data  
        GetSalesOrderDetailData(salesOrderNumber, ref dataset);  
  
        // Create a report data source for the sales order detail   
        // data  
        ReportDataSource dsSalesOrderDetail =  
            new ReportDataSource();  
        dsSalesOrderDetail.Name = "SalesOrderDetail";  
        dsSalesOrderDetail.Value =  
            dataset.Tables["SalesOrderDetail"];  
  
        localReport.DataSources.Add(dsSalesOrderDetail);  
  
        // Create a report parameter for the sales order number   
        ReportParameter rpSalesOrderNumber = new ReportParameter();  
        rpSalesOrderNumber.Name = "SalesOrderNumber";  
        rpSalesOrderNumber.Values.Add("SO43661");  
  
        // Set the report parameters for the report  
        localReport.SetParameters(  
            new ReportParameter[] { rpSalesOrderNumber });  
  
        // Refresh the report  
        reportViewer1.RefreshReport();  
    }  
  
    private void GetSalesOrderData(string salesOrderNumber,  
                                   ref DataSet dsSalesOrder)
