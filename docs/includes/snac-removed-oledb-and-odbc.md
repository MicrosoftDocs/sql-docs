The [SQL Server Native Client](../relational-databases/native-client/sql-server-native-client.md) (often abbreviated SNAC) has been removed from [!INCLUDE[sssql22-md](sssql22-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] 19 (SSMS). The SQL Server Native Client (SQLNCLI or SQLNCLI11) and the legacy Microsoft OLE DB Provider for SQL Server (SQLOLEDB) are not recommended for new development. Switch to the new [Microsoft OLE DB Driver (MSOLEDBSQL) for SQL Server](../connect/oledb/oledb-driver-for-sql-server.md) or the latest [Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server](../connect/odbc/microsoft-odbc-driver-for-sql-server.md) going forward.
