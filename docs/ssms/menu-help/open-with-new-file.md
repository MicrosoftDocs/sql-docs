# Open With (New File)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md.md)]
You can open a document in one or more editors by clicking **Open** on the **File** menu and then clicking **File**. In the **Open File** dialog box, select the file, click the **Open** arrow, and then click **Open With**. In the **Open With** dialog box, in the **Select a program to open** list, click the preferred program, and then click **Open**.  
  
## Options  
**Select a program to open**  
Lists the editors available in [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame_md.md)] Visual Studio for the selected type of file. Choose the editor with which to open the document from the list displayed, or click **Add** to include a new editor in the list.  
  
**Open**  
Click **Open** to open the document in the selected editor.  
  
**Add**  
Click this button to add a program to the list under **Select a program to open**. You can either type the file path to the program in the **Program Name** field or browse to the program's location by clicking **Browse**. In **Friendly Name**, enter a program name to display in the list under **Select a program to open**.  
  
**Remove**  
To remove a program, select the program and then click **Remove**.  
  
**Set as Default**  
To specify a default editor (and language encoding options, if applicable) for the type of file selected, choose a program from the list under **Select a program to open** and then click **Set as Default**. The next time you open this type of file in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], the document will open in the new default editor.  
  
> [!NOTE]
