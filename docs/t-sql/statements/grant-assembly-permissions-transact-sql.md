# GRANT Assembly Permissions (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server SQL Database](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

  Grants permissions on an assembly.  
  
 ![Topic link icon](../../database-engine/configure-windows/media/topic-link.gif "Topic link icon") [Transact-SQL Syntax Conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```syntaxsql
GRANT { permission [ ,...n ] } ON ASSEMBLY :: assembly_name  
    TO database_principal [ ,...n ]  
    [ WITH GRANT OPTION ]  
    [ AS granting_principal ]  
```  
  
[!INCLUDE[sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation](../../includes/sql-server-tsql-previous-offline-documentation.md)]

## Arguments
 *permission*  
 Specifies a permission that can be granted on an assembly. Listed below.  
  
 ON ASSEMBLY **::**_assembly_name_  
 Specifies the assembly on which the permission is being granted. The scope qualifier "::" is required.  
  
 *database_principal*  
 Specifies the principal to which the permission is being granted. One of the following:  
  
-   database user  
-   database role  
-   application role  
-   database user mapped to a Windows login  
-   database user mapped to a Windows group  
-   database user mapped to a certificate  
-   database user mapped to an asymmetric key  
-   database user not mapped to a server principal.  
  
GRANT OPTION  
 Indicates that the principal will also be given the ability to grant the specified permission to other principals.  
  
AS *granting_principal*  
 Specifies a principal from which the principal executing this query derives its right to grant the permission. One of the following:  
  
-   database user  
-   database role  
-   application role  
-   database user mapped to a Windows login  
-   database user mapped to a Windows group  
-   database user mapped to a certificate  
-   database user mapped to an asymmetric key  
-   database user not mapped to a server principal.  
  
## Remarks  
 An assembly is a database-level securable contained by the database that is its parent in the permissions hierarchy. The most specific and limited permissions that can be granted on an assembly are listed below, together with the more general permissions that include them by implication.  
  
|Assembly permission|Implied by assembly permission|Implied by database permission|  
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|  
|CONTROL|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|TAKE OWNERSHIP|CONTROL|CONTROL|  
|ALTER|CONTROL|ALTER ANY ASSEMBLY|  
|REFERENCES|CONTROL|REFERENCES|  
|VIEW DEFINITION|CONTROL|VIEW DEFINITION|  
  
## Permissions  
 The grantor (or the principal specified with the AS option) must have either the permission itself with GRANT OPTION, or a higher permission that implies the permission being granted.  
  
 If using the AS option, these additional requirements apply.  
  
|AS *granting_principal*|Additional permission required|  
|------------------------------|------------------------------------|  
|Database user|IMPERSONATE permission on the user, membership in the **db_securityadmin** fixed database role, membership in the **db_owner** fixed database role, or membership in the **sysadmin** fixed server role.|  
|Database user mapped to a Windows login|IMPERSONATE permission on the user, membership in the **db_securityadmin** fixed database role, membership in the **db_owner** fixed database role, or membership in the **sysadmin** fixed server role.|  
|Database user mapped to a Windows group|Membership in the Windows group, membership in the **db_securityadmin** fixed database role, membership in the **db_owner** fixed database role, or membership in the **sysadmin** fixed server role.|  
|Database user mapped to a certificate|Membership in the **db_securityadmin** fixed database role, membership in the **db_owner** fixed database role, or membership in the **sysadmin** fixed server role.|  
|Database user mapped to an asymmetric key|Membership in the **db_securityadmin** fixed database role, membership in the **db_owner** fixed database role, or membership in the **sysadmin** fixed server role.|  
|Database user not mapped to any server principal|IMPERSONATE permission on the user, membership in the **db_securityadmin** fixed database role, membership in the **db_owner** fixed database role, or membership in the **sysadmin** fixed server role.|  
|Database role|ALTER permission on the role, membership in the **db_securityadmin** fixed database role, membership in the **db_owner** fixed database role, or membership in the **sysadmin** fixed server role.|  
|Application role|ALTER permission on the role, membership in the **db_securityadmin** fixed database role, membership in the **db_owner** fixed database role, or membership in the **sysadmin** fixed server role.|  
  
 Object owners can grant permissions on the objects they own. Principals with CONTROL permission on a securable can grant permission on that securable.  
  
 Grantees of CONTROL SERVER permission, such as members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role, can grant any permission on any securable in the server. Grantees of CONTROL permission on a database, such as members of the **db_owner** fixed database role, can grant any permission on any securable in the database. Grantees of CONTROL permission on a schema can grant any permission on any object within the schema.
