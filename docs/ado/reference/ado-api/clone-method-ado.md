# Clone Method (ADO)
Creates a duplicate [Recordset](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/recordset-object-ado.md) object from an existing **Recordset** object. Optionally, specifies that the clone be read-only.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
Set rstDuplicate = rstOriginal.Clone (LockType)  
```  
  
## Return Value  
 Returns a **Recordset** object reference.  
  
#### Parameters  
 *rstDuplicate*  
 An object variable that identifies the duplicate **Recordset** object to be created.  
  
 *rstOriginal*  
 An object variable that identifies the **Recordset** object to be duplicated.  
  
 *LockType*  
 Optional. A [LockTypeEnum](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/locktypeenum.md) value that specifies either the lock type of the original **Recordset**, or a read-only **Recordset**. Valid values are **adLockUnspecified** or **adLockReadOnly**.  
  
## Remarks  
 Use the **Clone** method to create multiple, duplicate **Recordset** objects, especially if you want to maintain more than one current record in a given set of records. Using the **Clone** method is more efficient than creating and opening a new **Recordset** object that uses the same definition as the original.  
  
 The [Filter](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/filter-property.md) property of the original **Recordset**, if any, will not be applied to the clone. Set the **Filter** property of the new **Recordset** to filter the results. The simplest way to copy any existing **Filter** value is to assign it directly, as follows.  
  
```  
rsNew.Filter = rsOriginal.Filter  
```  
  
 The current record of a newly created clone is set to the first record.  
  
 Changes you make to one **Recordset** object are visible in all of its clones regardless of cursor type. However, after you execute [Requery](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/requery-method.md) on the original **Recordset**, the clones will no longer be synchronized to the original.  
  
 Closing the original **Recordset** does not close its copies, nor does closing a copy close the original or any of the other copies.  
  
 You can only clone a **Recordset** object that supports bookmarks. Bookmark values are interchangeable; that is, a bookmark reference from one **Recordset** object refers to the same record in any of its clones.  
  
 Some **Recordset** events that are triggered will also occur in all **Recordset** clones. However, because the current record can differ between cloned **Recordsets**, the events may not be valid for the clone. For example, if you change a value of a field, a [WillChangeField](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/willchangefield-and-fieldchangecomplete-events-ado.md) event will occur in the changed **Recordset** and in all clones. The *Fields* parameter of the **WillChangeField** event of a cloned **Recordset** (where the change was not made) will refer to the fields of the current record of the clone, which may be a different record than the current record of the original **Recordset** where the change occurred.  
  
 The following table provides a full listing of all **Recordset** events. It indicates whether they are valid and triggered for any recordset clones generated by using the **Clone** method.
