## In This Section  
 [Understanding the WMI Provider for Server Events](../../relational-databases/wmi-provider-server-events/understanding-the-wmi-provider-for-server-events.md)  
 Provides an overview of the provider architecture and how SQL Server Agent can be programmed to work with it.  
  
 [Working with the WMI Provider for Server Events](../../relational-databases/wmi-provider-server-events/working-with-the-wmi-provider-for-server-events.md)  
 Explains the factors that you need to consider before programming with the provider.  
  
 [Using WQL with the WMI Provider for Server Events](../../relational-databases/wmi-provider-server-events/using-wql-with-the-wmi-provider-for-server-events.md)  
 Explains the WMI Query Language (WQL) syntax and how to use it when you program against the provider.  
  
 [Sample: Creating a SQL Server Agent Alert by Using the WMI Provider for Server Events](../../relational-databases/wmi-provider-server-events/sample-creating-a-sql-server-agent-alert-with-the-wmi-provider.md)  
 Provides an example of using the WMI Provider to return trace event information on which to create a SQL Server Agent alert.
