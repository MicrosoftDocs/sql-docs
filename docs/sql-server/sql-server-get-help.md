# SQL Server help and feedback

This article explains different ways to get assistance with an issue or provide feedback for SQL Server or the SQL Server technical documentation.

## Contact Microsoft Support

Customers with a Premier or Unified support plan can [open a ticket](https://serviceshub.microsoft.com/support/create) with Microsoft support. For more information, visit the [Microsoft Services Hub Resource Center](/services-hub/unified/).

Customers with a Professional or Business support plan can [open a ticket](https://support.serviceshub.microsoft.com/supportforbusiness/create) with Microsoft support. For more information, review [Professional Support FAQ](/services-hub/sfbus/support-for-business/professional-support-faqs).

Customers with an Azure technical support plan can [open a ticket](/azure/azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request) with Microsoft support.

You can also use the [Global Customer Service phone numbers](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/global-customer-service-phone-numbers-c0389ade-5640-e588-8b0e-28de8afeb3f2) to open a support ticket.

## Troubleshooting documentation

You can find all the latest troubleshooting guidance and resolution to common issues in the [SQL Server Troubleshooting documentation](/troubleshoot/sql/).

## Review known issues

You can check the following resources to understand if you encounter any known issues.

We publish our bug fix list in the [SQL Server builds spreadsheet](https://aka.ms/sqlserverbuilds). This spreadsheet contains tabs with detailed fix list for our mainstream supported versions [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../includes/sssql22-md.md)], [!INCLUDE [sssql19-md](../includes/sssql19-md.md)], and [!INCLUDE [sssql17-md](../includes/sssql17-md.md)]. You can sort this list by component and feature, and understand when a specific issue was fixed. Each fix item is also linked to its own article reference, which provides more details about the problem and any applicable workaround.

When we publish a Cumulative Update, we publish a Knowledge Base article that corresponds to that update. For example, [SQL Server 2022 Cumulative Update 2](/troubleshoot/sql/releases/sqlserver-2022/cumulativeupdate2). You can see the table in that article that shows the "Improvements and fixes included in this update".

If we detect that an update introduced a problem or regression, then we immediately add it as a "Known issues in this update" section of the same article. For example in [Cumulative Update 19 for SQL Server 2019](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/5023049), you notice two issues highlighted that were introduced in that update.

Every major release of the product is accompanied by the release notes for that version. The release notes of that version document known issues associated with the release.

For example:

- [SQL Server 2022 release notes](sql-server-2022-release-notes.md)
- [SQL Server 2019 release notes](sql-server-2019-release-notes.md)
