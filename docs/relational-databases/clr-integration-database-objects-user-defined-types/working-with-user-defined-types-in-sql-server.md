# Working with User-Defined Types in SQL Server
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
  You can access user-defined type (UDT) functionality in [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] from the [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] language by using regular query syntax. UDTs can be used in the definition of database objects, as variables in [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] batches, in functions and stored procedures, and as arguments in functions and stored procedures.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Defining UDT Tables and Columns](../../relational-databases/clr-integration-database-objects-user-defined-types/working-with-user-defined-types-defining-udt-tables-and-columns.md)  
 Describes how to use [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] to create a UDT column in a table.  
  
 [Manipulating UDT Data](../../relational-databases/clr-integration-database-objects-user-defined-types/working-with-user-defined-types-manipulating-udt-data.md)  
 Describes how to use [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] to work with UDT data in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].
