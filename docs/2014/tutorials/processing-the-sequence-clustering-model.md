# Processing the Sequence Clustering Model
  After you create a new mining structure, you must deploy the changes that you made to the data mining solution, and then process the structure. After processing of both the new structure and the mining model is complete, you can browse the mining model.  
  
 Processing is always required when you create a new data mining structure. However, if you add a new mining model to an existing structure, you can process just the mining model. In this scenario, because you have created a new mining structure and a new mining model, you must process both.  
  
### To process the mining structure and model  
  
1.  On the **Mining Model** menu of [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], select **Process Mining Structure and All Models**.  
  
2.  At the warning asking whether you want to build and deploy the project, click **Yes**.  
  
3.  In the **Process Mining Structure - Sequence Clustering with Region** dialog box, click **Run**.  
  
     The **Process Progress** dialog box opens to display information about model processing. Processing of the new structure and model might take some time.  
  
4.  After processing is complete, click **Close** to exit the **Process Progress** dialog box.  
  
5.  Click **Close** again to exit the **Process Mining Structure - Sequence Clustering with Region** dialog box.
