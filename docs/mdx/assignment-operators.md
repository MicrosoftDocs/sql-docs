# Assignment Operators
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx_md](../includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  In Multidimensional Expressions (MDX), the assignment operator is the equal sign (=).  
  
 The assignment operator is used to assign values to subcubes in MDX Script. For more information, see [MDX Scripting Fundamentals &#40;Analysis Services&#41;](../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/mdx/mdx-scripting-fundamentals-analysis-services.md).
