# Extended events for SQL Server Machine Learning Services
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly.md)]

SQL Server provides a set of extended events to use in troubleshooting operations related to the [!INCLUDE[rsql_launchpad](../../includes/rsql-launchpad-md.md)], as well as Python or R jobs sent to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].

**Applies to:**  SQL Server 2016 R Services, SQL Server 2017 Machine Learning Services

## SQL Server events for machine learning

To view a list of events related to SQL Server, run the following query from [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)].

```sql
SELECT o.name AS event_name, o.description
FROM sys.dm_xe_objects o
JOIN sys.dm_xe_packages p
ON o.package_guid = p.guid
WHERE o.object_type = 'event'
AND p.name = 'SQLSatellite';
```

For general information about using extended events, see [Extended Events Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/extended-events/extended-events-tools).

> [!TIP]
> For extended event generated by SQL Server, try the new [SSMS XEvent profiler](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/extended-events/use-the-ssms-xe-profiler). This new feature in Management Studio displays a live viewer for extended events, and is less intrusive to the SQL Server than a similar Profiler trace.

## Additional events specific to machine learning components

Additional extended events are available for components that are related to and used by SQL Server Machine Learning Services, such as the [!INCLUDE[rsql_launchpad](../../includes/rsql-launchpad-md.md)], and BXLServer, the satellite process that starts the R runtime. These additional extended events are fired from the external processes, and thus must be captured using an external utility.

For more information about how to do this, see the section, [Collecting events from external processes](#bkmk_externalevents).

##  <a name="bkmk_xeventtable"></a> Table of extended events

|Event|Description|Notes|  
|-----------|-----------------|---------|  
|connection_accept|Occurs when a new connection is accepted. This event serves to log all connection attempts.||  
|failed_launching|Launching failed.|Indicates an error.|  
|satellite_abort_connection|Abort connection record||  
|satellite_abort_received|Fires when an abort message is received over a satellite connection.||  
|satellite_abort_sent|Fires when an abort message is sent over satellite connection.||  
|satellite_authentication_completion|Fires when authentication completes for a connection over TCP or Namedpipe.||  
|satellite_authorization_completion|Fires when authorization completes for a connection over TCP or Namedpipe.||  
|satellite_cleanup|Fires when satellite calls cleanup.|Fired only from external process. See instructions on collecting events from external processes.|  
|satellite_data_chunk_sent|Fires when the satellite connection finishes sending a single data chunk.|The event reports the number of rows sent, the number of columns, the number of SNI packets usedm and time elapsed in milliseconds while sending the chunk. The information can help you understand how much time is spent passing different types of data, and how many packets are used.|

###  <a name="bkmk_externalevents"></a> Collecting events from external processes

SQL Server Machine Learning Services starts some services that run outside of the SQL Server process. To capture events related to these external processes, you must create an events trace configuration file and place the file in the same directory as the executable for the process.  
  
+ **[!INCLUDE[rsql_launchpad](../../includes/rsql-launchpad-md.md)]**   
  
    To capture events related to the Launchpad, place the *.config* file in the Binn directory for the SQL Server instance.  In a default installation, this would be:

    `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL_version_number.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Binn`.  
  
+ **BXLServer** is the satellite process that supports SQL extensibility with external script languages, such as R or Python. A separate instance of BxlServer is launched for each external language instance.
  
    To capture events related to BXLServer, place the *.config* file in the R or Python installation directory.  In a default installation, this would be:
     
    **R:** `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL_version_number.MSSQLSERVER\R_SERVICES\library\RevoScaleR\rxLibs\x64`.  

    **Python:** `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL_version_number.MSSQLSERVER\PYTHON_SERVICES\library\RevoScaleR\rxLibs\x64`.

The configuration file must be named the same as the executable, using the format "[name].xevents.xml". In other words, the files must be named as follows:

+ `Launchpad.xevents.xml`
+ `bxlserver.xevents.xml`

The configuration file itself has the following format:

```xml
\<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>  
<event_sessions>  
<event_session name="[session name]" maxMemory="1" dispatchLatency="1" MaxDispatchLatency="2 SECONDS">  
    <description owner="you">Xevent for launchpad or bxl server.</description>  
    <event package="SQLSatellite" name="[XEvent Name 1]" />  
    <event package="SQLSatellite" name="[XEvent Name 2]" />  
    <target package="package0" name="event_file">  
      <parameter name="filename" value="[SessionName].xel" />  
      <parameter name="max_file_size" value="10" />  
      <parameter name="max_rollover_files" value="10" />  
    </target>  
  </event_session>  
</event_sessions>  
```

+ To configure the trace, edit the *session name* placeholder, the placeholder for the filename (`[SessionName].xel`), and the names of the events you want to capture, For example, `[XEvent Name 1]`, `[XEvent Name 1]`).  
+ Any number of event package tags may appear, and will be collected as long as the name attribute is correct.

### Example: Capturing Launchpad events

The following example shows the definition of an event trace for the Launchpad service:

```xml
\<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>  
<event_sessions>  
<event_session name="sqlsatelliteut" maxMemory="1" dispatchLatency="1" MaxDispatchLatency="2 SECONDS">  
    <description owner="hay">Xevent for sql tdd runner.</description>  
    <event package="SQLSatellite" name="launchpad_launch_start" />  
    <event package="SQLSatellite" name="launchpad_resume_sent" />  
    <target package="package0" name="event_file">  
      <parameter name="filename" value="launchpad_session.xel" />  
      <parameter name="max_file_size" value="10" />  
      <parameter name="max_rollover_files" value="10" />  
    </target>  
  </event_session>  
</event_sessions>  
```

+ Place the *.config* file in the Binn directory for the SQL Server instance.
+ This file must be named `Launchpad.xevents.xml`.

### Example: Capturing BXLServer events  

The following example shows the definition of an event trace for the BXLServer executable.
  
```xml
\<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>  
<event_sessions>  
 <event_session name="sqlsatelliteut" maxMemory="1" dispatchLatency="1" MaxDispatchLatency="2 SECONDS">  
    <description owner="hay">Xevent for sql tdd runner.</description>  
    <event package="SQLSatellite" name="satellite_abort_received" />  
    <event package="SQLSatellite" name="satellite_authentication_completion" />  
    <event package="SQLSatellite" name="satellite_cleanup" />  
    <event package="SQLSatellite" name="satellite_data_receive_completion" />  
    <event package="SQLSatellite" name="satellite_data_send_completion" />  
    <event package="SQLSatellite" name="satellite_data_send_start" />  
    <event package="SQLSatellite" name="satellite_schema_sent" />   
    <event package="SQLSatellite" name="satellite_unexpected_message_received" />    
    <event package="SQLSatellite" name="satellite_data_chunk_sent" />   
    <target package="package0" name="event_file">  
      <parameter name="filename" value="satellite_session.xel" />  
      <parameter name="max_file_size" value="10" />  
      <parameter name="max_rollover_files" value="10" />  
    </target>  
  </event_session>  
</event_sessions>  
```

+ Place the *.config* file in the same directory as the BXLServer executable.
+ This file must be named `bxlserver.xevents.xml`.
