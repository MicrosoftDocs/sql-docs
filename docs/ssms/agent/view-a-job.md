# View a Job
This topic describes how to view [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Agent jobs in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent_md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql_md.md)].  
  
**In This Topic**  
  
-   **Before you begin:**  
  
    [Security](#Security)  
  
-   **To view a job, using:**  
  
    [SQL Server Management Studio](#SSMS)  
  
    [Transact-SQL](#TSQL)  
  
    [SQL Server Management Objects](#SMO)

### <a name="Security"></a>Security  
You can only view jobs that you own, unless you are a member of the **sysadmin** fixed server role. Members of this role can view all jobs. For detailed information, see [Implement SQL Server Agent Security](../../ssms/agent/implement-sql-server-agent-security.md).  
  
## <a name="SSMS"></a>Using SQL Server Management Studio  
  
#### To view a job  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer,** connect to an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion_md.md)], and then expand that instance.  
  
2.  Expand **SQL Server Agent**, and then expand **Jobs**.  
  
3.  Right-click a job, and then click **Properties**.  
  
## <a name="TSQL"></a>Using Transact-SQL  
  
#### To view a job  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer**, connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde_md.md)].  
  
2.  On the Standard bar, click **New Query**.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and click **Execute**.  
  
    ```  
    -- lists all aspects of the information for the job NightlyBackups.  
    USE msdb ;  
    GO  
  
    EXEC dbo.sp_help_job  
        @job_name = N'NightlyBackups',  
        @job_aspect = N'ALL' ;  
    GO  
    ```  
  
## <a name="SMO"></a>Using SQL Server Management Objects  
**To view a job**  
  
Use the **Job** class by using a programming language that you choose, such as Visual Basic, Visual C#, or PowerShell. For more information, see [SQL Server Management Objects (SMO)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms162169.aspx).
