# Select Objects (Object Explorer)
  Use the **Select Objects** dialog box to add an object to a list in another dialog box. The dialog box title and the options available in the dialog box depend upon how it was opened. Only available options appear; for instance, only logins are available when you are selecting an owner for a new object.  
  
## Options  
 **Select these object types**  
 Displays a list of the types of which the objects to be selected belong. The types include [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] level and database level principals and securables. This box is populated from the selections made from the **Select Object Types** dialog box, accessed from the **Objects Type** button.  
  
 **Enter the object names to select**  
 Enter a semicolon-separated list of names of the objects to be selected. Objects to be selected must be of a type listed in the **Select these object types** box. Objects can be selected from a list accessed by clicking the **Browse** button.  
  
 **Object Types**  
 Displays a list of object types. Select one or more by selecting the check box corresponding to the type.  
  
 **Check Names**  
 Validates the object names in the **Enter the object names to select** box. If an object name that is not valid is listed, the **Name not Found** dialog box is presented. With this dialog box, the name can be corrected or removed from the list of objects to select.  
  
 **Browse**  
 Presents the **Browse for Objects** dialog box. This contains a list of objects of the types listed in the **Select These Object Types** box. Select objects from this list by selecting the corresponding check boxes.
