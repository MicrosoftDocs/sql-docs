# Lesson 1-1 - Creating an Analysis Services Project
[!INCLUDE[ssas-appliesto-sqlas](../includes/ssas-appliesto-sqlas.md)]

In the following task, you use [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] to create a new [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] project named **Analysis Services Tutorial**, based on the [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] Project template. A *project* is a collection of related objects. Projects exist within a solution, which includes one or more projects. For more information, see [Create an Analysis Services Project &#40;SSDT&#41;](../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/create-an-analysis-services-project-ssdt.md).  
  
### To create a new Analysis Services project  
  
1.  Open SQL Server Data Tools.  
  
  
2.  Create a new Analysis Services Multidimensional project. Choose the **Analysis Services Multidimensional and Data Mining Project** template.  
  
    Notice the default project name, location, and the default solution name are generated in the bottom of the dialog box. By default, a new directory is created for the solution.  
  
3.  Change the project Name to **Analysis Services Tutorial**, which also changes the **Solution name** box, and then click **OK**.  
  
You have successfully created the **Analysis Services Tutorial** project, based on the **Analysis Services Multidimensional and Data Mining Project** template, within a new solution that is also named **Analysis Services Tutorial**.
