# Enabling Visual Studio Analyzer
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Support for Visual Studio Analyzer was removed beginning in Windows 8 (Visual Studio Analyzer was only included in older versions of Visual Studio.). For an alternative troubleshooting mechanism, use BID tracing.  
  
 Microsoft Visual Studio Analyzer is an application-analysis tool designed to provide a high-level look at an application's performance across all tiers and systems. It focuses on the interaction between components. Visual Studio Analyzer can be started and stopped from the ODBC Administrator's Tracing tab.  
  
 To view any of the events that ODBC generates, follow these steps:  
  
1.  Access the ODBC Data Source Administrator.  
  
2.  Click the **Tracing** tab.  
  
3.  Click **Start Visual Studio Analyzer Tracing**.  
  
4.  Click **OK**.  
  
 Visual Studio Analyzer event-generation continues until **Stop Visual Studio Analyzer Tracing** is selected.
