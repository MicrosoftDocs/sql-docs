# Test an Action
[!INCLUDE[ssas-appliesto-sqlas](../../includes/ssas-appliesto-sqlas.md)]
  You test an action by using the Browser view in Cube Designer. Cube Designer can be accessed from [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)]. After you create the action, you must process the cube before the action can be tested. For more information, see [Processing a multidimensional model &#40;Analysis Services&#41;](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/processing-a-multidimensional-model-analysis-services.md).  
  
### To test an action  
  
1.  Open the cube that contains the action that you want to test, then under **View**, click **Browser**.  
  
2.  Drag the target object to either **Drop Column Fields Here** or **Drop Row Fields Here**.  
  
3.  In the view pane, right-click the object to which the action is attached (for example, a cell). The action name will appear in the context menu.  
  
4.  Click the action name to test the action.
