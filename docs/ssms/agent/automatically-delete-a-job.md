# Automatically Delete a Job
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdbmi-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdbmi-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> On [Azure SQL Database Managed Instance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance), most, but not all SQL Server Agent features are currently supported. See [Azure SQL Database Managed Instance T-SQL differences from SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-transact-sql-information#sql-server-agent) for details.

This topic describes how to configure [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] to automatically delete jobs when they succeed, fail, or complete by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] or SQL Server Management Objects.  
  
Job responses ensure that database administrators know when jobs complete and how frequently they run. Typical job responses include:  
  
-   Notifying the operator by using e-mail, electronic paging, or a **net send** message.  
  
    Use one of these job responses if the operator must perform a follow-up action. For example, if a backup job completes successfully, the operator must be notified to remove the backup tape and store it in a safe location.  
  
-   Writing an event message to the Windows application log.  
  
    You can use this response only for failed jobs.  
  
-   Automatically deleting the job.  
  
    Use this job response if you are certain that you do not need to rerun this job.

#### To automatically delete a job  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer,** connect to an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion_md.md)], and then expand that instance.  
  
2.  Expand **SQL Server Agent**, expand **Jobs**, right-click the job you want to edit, and then click **Properties**.  
  
3.  Select the **Notifications** page.  
  
4.  Check **Automatically delete job**, and choose one of the following:  
  
    -   Click **When the job succeeds** to delete the job status when it has completed successfully.  
  
    -   Click **When the job fails** to delete the job when it has completed unsuccessfully.  
  
    -   Click **When the job completes** to delete the job regardless of completion status.  
  
## <a name="SMO"></a>Using SQL Server Management Objects  
**To automatically delete a job**  
  
Use the **DeleteLevel** property of the **Job** class by using a programming language that you choose, such as Visual Basic, Visual C#, or PowerShell. For more information, see [SQL Server Management Objects (SMO)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms162169.aspx).
